KATE LEE FERGUSON.</p>

<p class="p2">“<span class="smcap">Cliquot</span>,” a new love romance from the pen of Kate Lee Ferguson, a rising young
Southern authoress of the Amélie Rives school, is full of passion, piquancy and breathless
interest. All through it possesses that quality which the French call chic, which
gives it that flavor which everybody likes. Neil Emory’s domestic drama&mdash;for he is a
man with a past in his history&mdash;and his deep-rooted passion for Gwendoline Gwinn, as
well as the fascination exerted upon him by Cassandra Clovis, an actress, are intermingled
with an exciting tale of the race-track in which the foremost figures are Cliquot,
a fleet but unmanageable racing stallion, and the mysterious jockey who rides him to
final victory after the superb horse has been the death of all his predecessors. The
scene is laid in the South and the agreeable volume gives a most charming glimpse
of fashionable Southern society. The racing incidents are very graphic and will take
a firm hold on all admirers of horse-flesh. “<span class="smcap">Cliquot</span>” is written in a sprightly style
and is just the book to raise a sensation and be talked about in every direction.</p>

<p class="p2"><em>“Cliquot,” a bright and peculiarly interesting novel in which burning
love and a wonderfully exciting episode of the race-course are the chief ingredients,
is the production of Kate Lee Ferguson, one of several young
Southern authors who have recently sprung up to cultivate the fruitful
field in which Amélie Rives has worked her way to notoriety. It is a
strong and spicy romance, always fresh and crisp, with never a superfluous
line and very interesting in the very first paragraph. The locality is the
South and the characters typical Southerners. Neil Emory, a man with a
past, is the hero, and the heroine is Gwendoline Gwinn, who, while admired
as a belle, petted by her mother and apparently fond of her ease, is
yet a woman to do and dare. A theatrical element is cleverly introduced
in the shape of two actresses, Cassandra Clovis and the mysterious “Kitty
Who Laughs.” The book takes its title from a thoroughbred racing stallion,
capable of great things on the turf but addicted to killing his jockeys.
A boy is at last found who rides him to a successful finish and about whom
some very singular developments are made. The description of the race
which the stallion wins is spirited and vivid to a high degree. Some of the
incidents are exceedingly naturalistic and striking. It is not too much to
say that “Cliquot” will be read with avidity and that it will be discussed
with considerable ardor, for, while it is undoubtedly absorbing, it touches
upon some topics which most writers have seen fit to avoid. But the best
way is to examine and find out for yourself.</em></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A SHORT HEAT.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Another jockey had been killed on the race-course.
The utmost excitement prevailed. The
magnificent animal which had caused the death reared
and plunged in the hands of a groom, his foam-covered
sides catching the dust from his flying heels.
The crowd poured and surged from the stand, while
the band still played. The two other horses were led
away, one quiet enough, but the other, a black gelding,
fretting and sidling through the throng.</p>

<p>Mr. Emory, the owner of the restless stallion, hurried
down the steps of the grand stand. He was a
tall blond, and wore a soft gray hat. He grew a shade
paler as he saw the dead man raised from the ground
by two hostlers, his broken neck dangling over the<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>
arm of one of them as they bore him through the
gate.</p>

<p>“Poor fellow!” he muttered, “and he thought he
could ride!”</p>

<p>He whispered a few words to his groom, then asked
a policeman to clear a passage, that his horse might
be led away, a thing not easily accomplished, as with
trembling limbs and quivering nostrils the beautiful
creature rose repeatedly in his tracks, while the man
swung to and fro at his bit. At length, he sprang
forward and rushed for the stable; breaking loose
beyond the gate, he dashed madly into his stall, when
the door was closed upon him, while the crowd yielded
and swayed and dashed about, in that aimless, foolish,
reckless way so often noticed under such circumstances.</p>

<p>Of course, there was the usual flutter and stir on
the ladies’ stand&mdash;a shutting of fans, a rustle of silk, and
the starting forward of some excitable ones. Exclamations
were heard of “How horrible!” “Oh! I
wish I’d never come!” or, “We women have no
business here!” while others thought, “I would not
have missed it, dreadful though it is!”</p>

<p>The race was off&mdash;thousands of dollars staked and
only one heat over. Which horse had won?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[23]</span></p>

<p>Now the police were busy, for the dead man’s form
and the maddened stallion no longer held the rabble
at bay. Tongues began to wag fast and faster, and
hot and hotter grew the discussions about the track
and pool stands. Yells of the officials for the police
to clear the sward for the next race filled the air,
and, finally, when the judge tapped the bell and the
crier announced that the race would come off the next
day, a little order was restored and the band began to
blow its loudest, as a couple of fillies trotted through
the gate.</p>

<p>But the excitement was over; and before long the
stand was half-empty, while the soft roll of carriage
wheels passed again and again through the exit and
the women were gone.</p>

<p>Neil Emory walked over to his stable and gave a
few directions to his groom, who had succeeded in
partially quieting his racer; then, turning, he hailed
a handsome carriage which was awaiting him a few
steps beyond the course. His companion and friend,
Reginald Gray, was inside, and the two drove rapidly
away.</p>

<p>Emory pulled his hat over his eyes and sank back,
as if he had lost a regiment of friends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[24]</span></p>

<p>“Hard lines,” said Gray. “Two jockeys in six
months.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied his companion, “and where on earth
will I find another willing to risk his neck on that
beast?”</p>

<p>“A few hundred dollars will find one.”</p>

<p>“I doubt it,” said Emory. “I will have to make
it a few thousands.”</p>

<p>“Well! considering the amount staked on the animal,
you will have to make it a couple, I dare say.”</p>

<p>They drove on in silence, the owner of the horse
busy with his thoughts and unwilling to discuss a
matter so close to his heart even with his best friend.</p>

<p>When they reached the city, Neil parted with his
companion and went up to his rooms. His servant
had lighted the gas and arranged his bath. He occupied
a handsome suite of apartments, and his sitting-room
was one of the prettiest in town, only the absence
of the usual display of lovely women’s photos distinguished
Neil Emory’s abode from all others. Perhaps
in some far-away corner, veiled, was a picture,
or, perhaps, only in his heart there existed such an
image, though most people thought it but that of a
rampant steed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[25]</span></p>

<p>When he had finished his toilet, it was quite dark.
Turning down the gas, he threw himself into a chair
at the open window. Thoughts, thoughts, thoughts,
wild and mad, surged through his brain.</p>

<p>Almost wealthy! Only a little while ago a comparatively
poor man, alone in the world, well born,
handsome and educated&mdash;but a little while since able
to purchase a small but beautiful estate, situated a
few miles from the city, sold at a bargain just as an
unlooked for legacy from a distant relation enabled
him to become the purchaser&mdash;but a little while ago
so fortunate as to buy at auction a young thoroughbred
stallion, which unexpectedly proved to be one
of the greatest racers of the age, but was possessed
of a disposition so unmanageable that but two men
had been found able to ride him, and both of those
had been killed. If he could but win this race, how
much it would mean for him! Money he must have,
come what might.</p>

<p>“Oh!” he exclaimed, rising and stretching forth his
arms in the gloom, “Cliquot, Cliquot, my beautiful,
win for me, win for me, or I perish!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Two nights after the day of the race there was a<span class="pagenum">[26]</span>
reception at the residence of Mrs. Dale, one of the
fashionable women of the city of N&mdash;&mdash;. Every one
spoke, more or less, of the accident on the course.</p>

<p>“They say,” said one, “that he has offered an
immense sum for a jockey.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said another; “over two thousand dollars.”</p>

<p>“I dare say he’ll find some fool to ride the beast,”
added a third, “and for far less money.”</p>

<p>“But,” said a bystander, “two days of the week have
passed and Emory has not unearthed his man yet.”</p>

<p>Just then Neil came down from the dressing-room
and entered the parlors. Little Selina Maury was
standing by the door.</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m glad you’ve come! I thought you were
so cut up that we wouldn’t see you to-night.”</p>

<p>He smilingly bowed his acknowledgments.</p>

<p>“Heavens!” thought the girl, “I wish Bob had so
lovely an expression! He does nothing but grin!”</p>

<p>Then she took a rose from her breast and held it out
to Neil.</p>

<p>He was fastening it in his coat when Mrs. Dale
came up.</p>

<p>“How late you are! Let me take you to the supper-room.
I dare say you may find an ice there.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[27]</span></p>

<p>Excusing himself to Miss Maury, the young man
went away with his hostess. There was a jam at the
door, which caused them to stop by a recessed window,
where a girl sat, leaning lazily back against the
cushions of a sofa, her slippered feet crossed before
her and the trail of a green silk coiled out on the
carpet beyond.</p>

<p>The soft fold of her dress under Neil’s foot caused
him to look up. She saw him and put her hand out
through the curtain.</p>

<p>“How d’ye do?” she said, in an indolent way.</p>

<p>He took the soft fingers, devoid of jewels, in his
and smiled again.</p>

<p>A dark, stylish man was beside her, holding an ice.
He brushed some crumbs of cake from his lap, looked
up, scowled slightly and spilled the ice.</p>

<p>The girl laughed a little.</p>

<p>“Can I replace it?” asked Neil.</p>

<p>“Oh, no,” she said; “I am glad it’s gone that way!
But do you think now that you could manage to procure
for me a very small glass of champagne, with
quantities of ice&mdash;quite a small glass, and mostly
<em>ice</em>?”</p>

<p>This she rather murmured than said, leaning back
and idly toying with a gauze fan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[28]</span></p>

<p>“I really don’t think I could,” replied Emory.
“You see what a jam there is.”</p>

<p>“I can!” exclaimed the young man beside her,
springing to his feet, and before they could utter a
word he was gone and Neil had taken his vacant
place.</p>

<p>“It’s all an awful bore; don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>He looked at her and, perhaps, heard her, “I do
not know.”</p>

<p>Oh! the white throat&mdash;the lovely jeweless throat
and hands&mdash;the glorious violet eyes, that graceful
drooping head, with its crown of waving, bronze-hued
hair, those supple limbs, clad in a close-fitting robe of
green silk!</p>

<p>“A bore! my God!” and the room grew dim, and
the lights went out, while before his eyes a maddened
crowd came, the dangling neck of a dead jockey rose,
and a foam-covered, rearing steed stood, while there
was a cry in Emory’s heart: “Cliquot, Cliquot, my
beautiful, win for me or I perish!”</p>

<p>“See, I have brought the wine,” and young Clayton
stood before them. The girl put the glass to her lips
and slowly drank. When she had finished, she toyed
with the ice at the bottom of the glass and looked
lazier than ever.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[29]</span></p>

<p>“Would you like to dance?” asked Clayton. “I
believe there is a band.”</p>

<p>“No,” she replied; “I never dance in a train. It
coils about one’s feet so, or gets around a man’s limbs
and I am constantly imagining that I am a serpent,
coiling and uncoiling in an earthly paradise.”</p>

<p>“A very beautiful and telling comparison,” said
Emory.</p>

<p>“But one I don’t like,” added Clayton, “for it leads
a fellow to look upon Miss Gwinn as a temptress.”</p>

<p>“Well!” said the girl, with a rippling laugh, “is a
little knowledge a dangerous thing?”</p>

<p>The but half-concealed fury which flashed from the
young man’s eyes showed Neil Emory a little of the
volcano that lurked beneath.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gwinn came up on the arm of a handsome
man. He had a courtly bearing, wore his silver hair
close cut, had a moustache, a complexion like a girl’s,
and was a wealthy sugar planter and desperately
enamoured Gwendoline Gwinn, this lovely girl who
held her court in the most indolent fashion. Her
mother was very gracious in her manner to him, and
spoke to her daughter at once.</p>

<p>“Will you come with us, my dear? It is almost<span class="pagenum">[30]</span>
time to leave and so many persons are asking where
you are.” Then, perceiving Emory, she said: “Have
you found a jockey?”</p>

<p>“Not yet, Madam; that is, none to suit, but I am
promised one to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Ah! indeed!” she said, indifferently, and was turning
away, when Selina Maury came by.</p>

<p>“Oh! Mr. Emory, do tell me, is the race really off,
or will there be a man to ride your lovely horse? I
am perfectly wild to see him again!” and in her
eager, restless way, with the usual girlish impulse,
she laid her hand on his arm, looking up into his
face as if a whole world of adoration were in her
eyes.</p>

<p>“Pretty enough eyes, too,” thought Neil, as he
smiled.</p>

<p>“If he looks that way again,” said the girl to herself,
“I’ll box Bob’s jaws when he kisses me!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Emory, “I hope he will run on Monday,
if the promised man suits. A blacksmith is to
bring a youngster to-morrow and I shall judge what
he can do. Would you like to see another jockey
tossed, Miss Gwinn?” he asked, laughing a little, hard
laugh as he turned to her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[31]</span></p>

<p>“Are they always killed?” she asked; “and does
it hurt very much to have one’s neck broken? I
wonder why persons will be so silly as to fall off and
get their necks broken!”</p>

<p>“But he was thrown,” cried Selina, “and so his
neck was cracked.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Gwendoline; “I don’t think I care to
see that any more; but I promise to be at the race,
if that comes off&mdash;and not the jockey.”</p>

<p>A little laugh from the bystanders, and then she
rose, slowly drawing herself away from the dark cushions,
and, uncoiling her train from around her feet,
bowed to those beside her and glided after her
mother in and out of the crowd, like a long green
serpent.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A DEVIL’S LAUGH.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">As a bright red streak on the horizon foretold the
coming of a beautiful day in early spring, Neil
Emory galloped along the dusty road to the race-course,
and, turning in at its gates, drew rein at the
door of his trainer’s tent.</p>

<p>“Has that boy come?” he asked, as his horse was
led off by the groom.</p>

<p>“I think so. I’ll ask Joe.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the man returned, saying that
both the blacksmith and the boy had been waiting
quite a while.</p>

<p>Emory walked out towards the track, where a few
shade trees stood, just inside of the low fence. The
trainer went to call the blacksmith, who came from
behind the stables, followed by a rather slim boy, who
stopped to chunk at some chickens pecking in the
saw-dust. The youngster stood a little apart, ten or
twelve yards off, and threw clods of earth at them,
laughing a trifle when one was struck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[33]</span></p>

<p>“Is that the lad?” asked Emory.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied the blacksmith, a broad-shouldered,
dark-haired specimen of humanity.</p>

<p>“What is your name?” asked Emory, taking out
his note-book. “I want to know it and the boy’s,
too, for this is a business transaction, and I am offering
a pretty large reward to the fellow who rides this
race&mdash;a couple of thousand for the run and a hundred
dollars for every race he wins.”</p>

<p>“My name is Jess Peleg; the lad we call Jack.”</p>

<p>“Jack what?” demanded Emory, pausing with his
pencil in his hand. “I must know how to write the
check, if the fellow isn’t killed.”</p>

<p>“Jack Lacy,” replied the blacksmith. “Shall he
try the stallion to-day, sir?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, of course; right away!” exclaimed
Emory. “This is Thursday, and we’ve only till Monday
to get him used to the lad. Bring out the rascal,”
he added, turning to his groom, who was close
at hand.</p>

<p>Quite a little crowd of jockeys and retainers had
collected and stood by to watch the trial of a new
hand on this wonderful horse. There was perfect
silence. How would he succeed?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[34]</span></p>

<p>The lad still chunked the chickens. The stable
door flew open, and the horse came out, trotting and
snorting a little and holding up his beautiful head to
sniff the morning air. He was a rich chestnut sorrel,
rather over-sized; limbs long and supple as a deer’s,
throat slightly arched, a mane as wavy and bronzed
as Gwendoline’s hair. His blanket removed, after
walking him a little the saddle was put on, all quietly
enough.</p>

<p>“Jack,” said Peleg, “come here.”</p>

<p>The boy rubbed his soiled hands over his face, and,
sticking them into his pockets, walked slowly up. He
wore a suit of common clothes and a battered hat. His
hair was black, curling close to his head, and his face
very dirty. The blacksmith went up and whispered
something to him. The boy looked at Emory from
under his hat and nodded.</p>

<p>“He wants a little cash,” said Peleg. “He hasn’t any
jockey clothes.”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Neil, “but I’ve only a five dollar
gold-piece with me; will he take that?”</p>

<p>So saying, he tossed the coin towards the boy, who
caught it in his hand, put it between his white teeth
and then, with a low chuckle, slipped it into his<span class="pagenum">[35]</span>
pocket. The horse was now ready. The lad came
alongside of him, took the reins in his right hand,
and, putting his left under the animal’s mane, began
to pass it slowly towards his ears. As he did so, the
horse lowered his head and gave a quivering neigh.
The boy’s hand went softly around his forehead, then
crept down his nose and rested for a moment over
his nostrils, as he brought his mouth close to his ear
as if breathing therein, and again the horse neighed.
Then, putting his foot in the stirrup, the lad swung
himself into the saddle, and, gathering up the reins,
walked the racer off.</p>

<p>“Hiogh-dough!” laughed the groom.</p>

<p>The walk became a trot, and soon the soft dust
rose as he galloped gently around the track. Again
he passed, going a little faster, and then they saw
but a flying streak, which, as it neared the turn, came
down the quarter stretch like a whirlwind, the beautiful
neck straight out and the rider on the horse’s
back as firm as a young Indian.</p>

<p>“At last!” sighed Emory, as he folded his arms
across his breast. “Now we will give them a race!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the voice of the blacksmith at his side,
“and such a race as they never saw before!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[36]</span></p>

<p>“If he wins,” exclaimed Neil, “I’ll give you the
finest anvil that’s to be bought, Peleg.”</p>

<p>“Book that,” said the man, “for he’ll win!” and the
stallion came in on his home gallop.</p>

<p>The sun was gilding the steeples of the city when
Emory rode home. His iron-gray bounded lightly
beneath the saddle and came down to a soft, cool
walk as his hoofs struck the first stones.</p>

<p>“And if I win,” said the rider to himself, “how
shall I be rewarded?”</p>

<p>Did he remember, two years before, when he looked
so coldly on Gwendoline Gwinn as she stood beside
that lovely dark-haired cousin, who had won, at least,
his hand? Did he recall the bright hours of his boyhood,
when that tall, lithe, red-haired girl romped at
his side and seemed to possess so little claim to the
beauty she now showed to the world? Had she,
indeed, loved him when he returned home from abroad,
and found her so regal a woman? Or, was it only a
trap to catch a proud heart and toss it to another?
God knows! and, perhaps, the beautiful devil, once
his wife&mdash;really his wife&mdash;could answer. Wealth! Who
has not felt its power? Would the year of grace
never end? A lie, a living, breathing lie to the outside<span class="pagenum">[37]</span>
world! His wife still lived, and he, too, lived
on, and link upon link the chains gathered around
him. One word and it would be done, one look and
it would be over! One embrace, one kiss of the
soul’s passion and hell would yawn&mdash;yet, with so glorious
a heaven, would the depths be as nothing!</p>

<p>And so, in the early morning, he rode, seeking at
last the brightness of his chambers to draw down the
blinds and pace back and forth like a yellow lion in
its cage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Mrs. Gwinn came into her sitting-room and rang
the bell for her maid, who, just then, passed the door,
hurrying to the kitchen.</p>

<p>“Where are you going, Alice?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Oh! ma’am, the hot water pipes are out of order,
and I am going below for some warm water for Miss
Gwendoline’s bath.”</p>

<p>“Hot water!” cried the mother, “on such a warm
day? You know Miss Gwinn always takes a cold
bath.”</p>

<p>“But, mamma,” said a voice from above, “I feel
awfully lazy this morning, and you know there’s nothing
requires so much exertion as a cold bath; besides,<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>
it was always your idea and not mine. Do let me
have my own way occasionally!”</p>

<p>“Her own way,” thought her mother&mdash;“that she
has very often,” and she glanced at the vision above
her, in its flowing pink wrapper, the fair arms resting
on the balusters and the tumbled bronze hair falling
on her shoulders. Then, closing her sitting-room door,
she shut her eyes for a moment, and, placing her
hand over them, to exclude all but her thoughts, said
aloud:</p>

<p>“Yes, Gwendoline must marry for money&mdash;she is
too beautiful for a cottage&mdash;and we sell our idols
high.”</p>

<p>When Gwendoline was dressed, she came downstairs
and greeted her mother. She wore a long
white morning dress, trimmed with lace and ribbon;
and very lovely she looked, as she sank upon the
sofa in the middle of the room.</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy the reception, Gwendoline?”</p>

<p>“Not a great deal,” answered her daughter. “I
got tired of Clayton.”</p>

<p>“But not of Col. Coutell?” asked Mrs. Gwinn,
eagerly.</p>

<p>“Yes, rather. Don’t you think he is a little old,<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>
and far too stately in his ways?” and the girl looked
in a careless, listless manner across the room.</p>

<p>“Gwendoline!” exclaimed her mother, sharply.
“This is folly! You know that Col. Coutell is deeply
in love with you and has spoken to me of his desire
to make you his wife. He is one of the wealthiest
of men, and you are aware that your father left us
but a bare competency. Can you, for a moment,
dream of the luxury of a love match&mdash;you, with your
idle society ways&mdash;you, who loll away the early morn
and play with the midnight hours? Oh! no, my
daughter; you must marry for a bed of roses, with a
gilded canopy!” and the handsome woman, who herself
had enjoyed all this, rose and crossed the room
to where her daughter sat, placing her white hand on
the girl’s shoulder, with a sarcastic laugh.</p>

<p>Gwendoline sprang to her feet, tossing her tawny
mane, as she shook off her mother’s hand.</p>

<p>“Mamma!” she exclaimed, “this is too much! I
will not be bartered for like a Virginia slave! I am
weary, weary of it all, and I can stand it no longer!
Why should I marry at all?”</p>

<p>“Why?” said her mother, waving her white hand
slowly back and forth. “Why, Gwendoline, for a<span class="pagenum">[40]</span>
very simple reason&mdash;you cannot help it! My dear,
you are hardly the woman to fill the role of an old
maid. No, no, there is too much fire there!” Then,
as she walked slowly to the end of the room, she
murmured below her breath, “Latent heat!”</p>

<p>The girl had thrown herself into a chair beside the
window. Just then a servant entered with a note for
Mrs. Gwinn, who, having read it, passed it to her
daughter.</p>

<p>“Well, will you accept?”</p>

<p>It seemed a long while, but at last an answer
came.</p>

<p>“Yes, I will go, mamma, and I will try to be as
agreeable as possible. I want to please you, just now.
I dare say it will be all right in the end.” A smile
crept slowly over the lips of the speaker, and she
repeated, quite low, “In the end!”</p>

<p>And so the note was answered, accepting Col. Coutell’s
invitation to Miss Gwinn for a ride on horseback
that afternoon&mdash;a gallop on her own little mare,
the one relic of departed glory. When her mother
left the room a few minutes later, the girl turned her
head as she lay back in her chair, and looked around
the pretty parlor, a dainty little place, with brightness<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>
over all. The cottage piano stood open and a piece
of new music was on the rack&mdash;she played a little,
now and then. On the wall, over the instrument,
hung a colored crayon picture of a little gray poodle,
holding a handkerchief in his mouth&mdash;a jolly face,
with big brown eyes, over which the fluffy hair hung.
There was a landscape at the back, and in the distance
a brown mare and colt were grazing.</p>

<p>“Poor little Fluffy,” murmured the girl, “how he
loved me&mdash;and they are all gone!”</p>

<p>Her face grew inexpressibly sad as she gazed on
the portrait. That day, after dinner, as they sat for
awhile in the parlor, Mrs. Gwinn remarked:</p>

<p>“Gwendoline, that picture’s the only ugly thing in
here.”</p>

<p>Next morning it hung in Gwendoline’s own room.</p>

<p>Emory met the pair later in the evening, returning
from their ride, and it seemed to him that never had
Gwendoline looked so beautiful, her dark green habit
fitting to perfection and the loveliness of her soft eyes
enhanced by the glow of health on her cheek. They
were riding slowly through the park and stopped for
a moment to speak to him. The tall form of the
Colonel showed well on horseback, and, in the gathering
twilight, he appeared almost a young man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[42]</span></p>

<p>Emory received his congratulations on his success
in securing a jockey.</p>

<p>“I trust he will do,” said Coutell, “and we will yet
see the race.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” replied Neil. “I am sure he’ll suit,
though I fear somewhat for the fellow’s life. There’s
no counting on such horses.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be in at the death!” cried Gwendoline, as she
glanced up with&mdash;for her&mdash;a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Emory, “I hope to save you that.”</p>

<p>Her eyelids fell and the sun went down.</p>

<p>Again ere midnight was it fated they should meet.</p>

<p>There was at that time, playing in the city, an
actress of some note and of peculiar standing&mdash;a woman
darkly beautiful, of good American family and a reputation
fair enough to secure her an entrée into some
of the best society wherever she went. She had paid
more than one visit to N&mdash;&mdash; and was a favorite; yet,
need I say, few women liked her?</p>

<p>For a week or so, she had held sway at the theatre
and that night was to witness her crowning success.
Lovers she had in plenty&mdash;pure love they called their
infatuation. Her manager was very careful of her, and
she shone forth a “Goddess among men.” The world<span class="pagenum">[43]</span>
of our city had given her some fond admirers, and
among those said to be the most ardent was Neil
Emory, who, report stated, knew her, in other places,
years before. That he had bent with warmth above
her chair at the receptions, and almost rested his blond
moustache on her white shoulders, was true. That he
had met her behind the scenes and wrapped her shawl
about her at the exposed wings and, once, perhaps,
driven her home in his coupé were also true. That
she had staked her jewels and even money upon his
racer were not denied, and that night, when the wealth
and beauty of N&mdash;&mdash; assembled to witness her final
triumph, many eyes and glasses were directed towards
the tall form that alone occupied the left-hand proscenium
box. Opposite, a lively party sat, the box on
the right being tenanted by Mrs. Dale, Gwendoline,
Mrs. Gwinn, Clayton and the inseparable Col. Coutell.
The play was a bewitching one, and continuous rounds
of applause greeted the great actress, Cassandra Clovis,
“she who inflames with love.” Yes, surely, to see
her was to be inflamed; yet modesty was her role&mdash;trains
and dress not too décolletée were her robes.
Those who gazed upon the hidden charms could but
wonder and sleep thus; and so, with glimmer and light,<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>
and flowers and jewels, while the air was stirred by
the flutter of perfumed fans, the play went on. Down
sped the curtain upon the fourth act; but one remained,
and when the orchestra had thundered out its last
notes, the curtain slowly rolled up and revealed a
scene new to all&mdash;a beautiful garden, not the old garden
set upon which N&mdash;&mdash; had so often gazed, but a
complete revelation of the beauties of nature&mdash;fountains
of real water, real roses, all as perfect as an
artist could make it; and, as the play went on with
only a little change here and there, at last came the
climax. There advanced adown the marble steps, portrayed
at the back of the stage, a party of gay maskers.
They were from the ball beyond.</p>

<p>“Ah!” exclaimed one, “they tell me that the fair
Cecilia will excel herself to-night. Her costume is to
be something marvelous&mdash;one to captivate.”</p>

<p>“Yes!” said a second, “to hold and fetter all.”</p>

<p>“Even him!” said a third.</p>

<p>And as they thus spoke and grouped themselves
about the stage the music softly arose and from beyond
the trees and through the vines came a form. Slowly
descending the steps, her long green mantle dropping
from her shoulders, came Cecilia. The beautiful dress<span class="pagenum">[45]</span>
in Roman style clung about her supple figure and as
she neared the footlights she turned to their full blaze
her right side, where, caught nearly to the hip, was
the soft white fabric, exposing to view her exquisite
limb, clothed in the palest of pink stockinet, while
glittering with a thousand gems, a natural sized horse-shoe
held the folds of her garment.</p>

<p>The house rang with applause from the men, in
which the women but faintly joined. From the right-hand
box a fleeting something fell, and, stooping with
wondrous grace, Clovis raised a mammoth bunch
of violets, pressed it to her lips, and then, with an
upward glance, placed it in the horse-shoe, where it
hung, the loosened flowers dropping upon the pink
below as she moved across the stage.</p>

<p>The passion flush that was for an instant upon
Emory’s face must have reflected its sunset in the
opposite box, for a white hand suddenly drew back
the lace curtains and Gwendoline’s beautiful visage,
flame-colored, flashed for a moment; and Neil could
not avoid meeting the eyes that sought his own, or
escape the slow smile that crept over the lips&mdash;a
cruel smile, he thought, a cold and cruel smile, that
had within itself the commencement of a devil’s laugh.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">SHE WHO INFLAMES WITH LOVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Cassandra Clovis arose late the next morning,
and, after a refreshing bath, made an elaborate
toilet and went out for a drive. She stopped
on her return and brought home the one woman for
whom she cared, Kitty Mays by name, a person who
deserves a brief mention in these pages.</p>

<p>In appearance Kitty Mays was exactly the opposite
of the actress. She was exceedingly small, with
a face so surrounded by flying, fluffy blond hair as
to be almost invisible, while a fluttering, restless
movement of head and shoulders, arms and body,
made the occasion rare when one could tell whether
she was pretty or not. And yet she was pretty.
Sometimes, suddenly checking her movements, she
would raise her face, and, throwing back her head,
open her beautiful mouth and give vent to laughter
long and rippling as a child’s, while the color came
into her cheeks and her eyes grew bright and large<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>
with mirth. Thus it was that on and off the stage
people went to hear “Kitty’s laugh,” carrying home
the remembrance of its bell-echo ripple. Was she
daft? Some thought so. Who had ever known her
to say or do anything bright? Was it that Clovis
kept her seated on her train to echo her smiles?
Was that laugh artificial? You must wait and see.
I shall help you all I can.</p>

<p>When they had sent away the carriage and laid
their hats aside, they ordered a lunch, with wine.
Kitty sat curled up on a sofa, but with characteristic
restlessness was tossing pieces of bread in the air and
trying to catch them in her mouth, her shaggy head
bobbing to and fro like a yellow poodle’s.</p>

<p>“Stop!” said Clovis; “you make me nervous.”</p>

<p>“Just one more time!” cried Kitty. “I’m sure to
catch the next.”</p>

<p>Again and again the white flakes flew up and
down; at last, one fell in the rosy mouth and the
white teeth closed.</p>

<p>“Ha! ha! ha!” and the silver bells rang.</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried a voice at the door. “May I
come in? I couldn’t make any one hear, so I strolled
this way. Say, now, did you leave the door open on
purpose?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[48]</span></p>

<p>“Go away,” said Kitty. “We don’t want you.
We are having a private rehearsal.”</p>

<p>“So I perceive; but I want to be admitted. Do,
Miss Clovis, ask me to have a glass of wine. I have
so many things to tell you.”</p>

<p>“Of course, of course,” she replied, as she rose and
rang the bell for another glass, and so Reginald Gray
came in.</p>

<p>“Catch!” said Kitty, throwing him a piece of
bread. He caught it in his hand.</p>

<p>“Not that way&mdash;like a dog!” and she held up
another piece.</p>

<p>“Be quiet,” said Clovis, “and go away, Kitty!
You may come back directly.”</p>

<p>The girl sprang from the sofa, and, without a
word, went into the next room, closing the door after
her.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Cassandra, “what did he think of
it?”</p>

<p>“He&mdash;was&mdash;shocked!” and her companion leaned
back, putting the tips of his fingers together.</p>

<p>“Tut! What did he say? Tell me&mdash;I really want
to know!” and she tapped her foot on the carpet.</p>

<p>“A great many things; among them that&mdash;that he<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>
was surprised and&mdash;and bewildered&mdash;by&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;the
brilliancy of the horse-shoe. By the by, would you
like a mate for it?” and he caught her by the wrist
as she held up her hand, lapping some wine from its
rosy hollow.</p>

<p>“Be careful, or you’ll spill it! There!” and she
threw it in his face, laughing, though her eyes
flashed.</p>

<p>He put his handkerchief up, removed it and looked
a trifle angry; then he walked over to where she
stood, and, catching her by both hands, imprisoned
them behind her and kissed her on the mouth.</p>

<p>“That’s all you’ll ever get,” she hissed through her
teeth.</p>

<p>“That’s all I want!” and he released her.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Ask Emory, when you are ready for a pair of
diamond horse-shoes,” and he took up his hat.</p>

<p>“You may tell him that when Cliquot wins I’ll be
ready; and you may give him my love, and say anything
else you choose quite safely, for I am sure his
horse will never reach the goal.”</p>

<p>She didn’t look at all amiable as she walked to the
window, where she caught hold of the tassel of the<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>
shade, running it up and down in a restless way, with
her back to her companion.</p>

<p>“Good-bye!” and in a moment he was gone.</p>

<p>“Kitty, come here!”</p>

<p>She threw open the door, and the girl appeared,
blowing bubbles.</p>

<p>“There! that’s Coutell!” and it broke. “That’s
Gray!” and it broke. “That’s Emory!&mdash;and it breaks
on your shoulder!” Again the laugh, rippling
through the room with bell-like music.</p>

<p>“Pshaw! listen to me. That man kissed me!”</p>

<p>“Ah! Did he hug you too?” and Kitty shook her
mane and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>“No!”</p>

<p>“Then he must have been intoxicated!” and the
little woman hummed a tune, as she clicked time
with an empty glass that stood on the table.</p>

<p>Clovis took up a bottle of red wine and filled one
of the glasses.</p>

<p>“Goodness! it looks like blood!” cried Kitty.</p>

<p>“Does it? Watch then!” and catching up her
skirts the beautiful woman exposed her well-formed
and graceful limb far above the knee clothed in a
dainty cream-colored stocking. Lifting her foot to a<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>
stool, she bent over and slowly poured the garnet
stream down her leg, whence it flowed in a long,
irregular line to the floor.</p>

<p>It was a lovely picture, as she stood in her rich
dress, staining the purity of her skin with so costly
a bath. Thus thought Reginald Gray, who had
paused for a moment in the passage beyond the door,
and drew back, pale with emotion, as he gazed upon
the scene before him.</p>

<p>“Gracious!” exclaimed Kitty, springing forward,
and turning her back to the opening, “I never felt
such a draught!”</p>

<p>Her skirts flew out beyond her, and the door closed
with a bang.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“OUT FROM THE GOLDEN DAY.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Yes, Neil Emory was a married man and a man
with a scandal, but a scandal so hushed and
screened by law and friends as to be almost forgotten.</p>

<p>One day the beautiful woman who bore his name
went away from him. You know many such stories.
I wish I could make this a new one. Perhaps it is
a little different from the hackneyed tales of the dashing
lover, who finally deserts his sweetheart, etc., etc.,
for this woman rose in the brightness of a May
morn, dressed herself for traveling, and, with satchel
in hand, walked into her husband’s study and told
him that she no longer loved him; that, in fact, she
never had loved him, nor ever would. It might be
she cared for another; and she was going away
forever. At the end of a year, she hoped he would
divorce her. No! she would listen to nothing he
might say. Should he compel her to remain he must<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>
bear the consequences. Who was the man? That
he should never know. Let her depart in peace, for
she knew he did not love her any more than she
loved him.</p>

<p>One year and she disappeared. The law crept
slowly on&mdash;as yet no release. “Would to God it
could come another way!” And now that he had
again met Gwendoline, did he know that he loved
her? If so, why rushed the color to his cheek when
the footlights flashed or the yellow dust rose around
the flying wheels of Cassandra’s coach?</p>

<p>He well knew he had many rivals. What could
he offer either girl or actress, wife or sweetheart?
His friend Reginald Gray was one for whom the
beautiful dark woman of the boards seemed ever to
smile; but “Kitty who laughed” was always on the
alert.</p>

<p>One day, as he sped swiftly down the street, a voice
hailed him. Turning, he beheld Clovis leaning from
her carriage; and when he came up, the slippered
foot peeping from the lace of her dress and the blue
veil over her face were all he saw of her companion.</p>

<p>“Did you get my message?” asked Clovis.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he murmured, “but I knew it meant nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[54]</span></p>

<p>“Hush!” she replied. “I want your good opinion,
and I’ll have it yet!”</p>

<p>Her lips closed tightly as she looked at him.</p>

<p>“You know that I am a poor man, Clovis&mdash;you
know that when Monday morning comes I will be
either richer by many thousands or ruined. What
will you have? A diamond horse-shoe or a worthless
kiss?”</p>

<p>“Neither!” said the woman. “I desire more&mdash;your
name!”</p>

<p>The man started back.</p>

<p>“That is impossible,” he said under his breath.</p>

<p>He started again, for a little bell sounded in his
ears&mdash;a little silver tinkle that must have come through
the carriage as the women drove off.</p>

<p>Would he never hear from the distant lawyer who
had his case in hand? As secretly as possible he
was conducting it. Gwendoline knew so little, her
mother more, perhaps, of his affairs. On what grounds
did he work? That his wife was untrue? No! That
they could not live together in peace? No! What
then? Only this: she had left him and asked for
release. One year! Perhaps it would come!</p>

<p>He went into his room and sat down. It was Saturday<span class="pagenum">[55]</span>
night and noisier than usual on the street. The
week had dragged slowly enough, yet he began to
dread the coming of that Monday morning, that day
which would mean so much for him. He shaded his
eyes from the soft twilight, and seemed to see it all!
The hot and restless crowd, the ever-penetrating rays
of the summer sun, the quivering, panting steed&mdash;and,
perhaps, the death of another jockey in the end.</p>

<p>“If this happens again,” he muttered to himself,
“I’ll blow out the infernal beast’s brains!”</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and on opening it
a telegram was placed in his hand. Slowly he tore
off the covering, thinking: “How tired I am!”</p>

<p>Yes, he was tired, so tired that the four words of
the telegram that should have brought him joy had
no effect except it was to rivet him to the spot; and
there, two, three hours later, he still sat looking down
upon the carpet, where the yellow paper had fallen,
with the writing upturned, and this is what he saw:</p>

<p>“Your wife is dead.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">PRETTY GOOD ARMS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Dead! Gone forever “out from the golden day.”
Just the release he had dreamed of, perhaps
wished for, yet hardly prayed for. Men seldom do
that; only women drop down on their knees and pour
out their hearts that way, rising sometimes to say it
is all for the best.</p>

<p>Emory at last rose from his chair and left his room.
It was almost midnight, and the streets were deserted
when he reached the City Park. A few steps brought
him to a seat under a tree, near which a fountain
splashed, a place where he had often sat alone.</p>

<p>“I’ll do as the fellow does in the novels&mdash;cool my
fevered brow,” he thought, and laughed a little, as he
took off his hat, caught some water in the hollow of
his hand and wet his forehead. The laugh was hard
and hollow, and the sigh that followed it heavy and
dull. Of course, he was not sorry for what the world
would call his “loss,” but he was a sick-hearted man,<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>
disgusted with the way his life began, horrified at the
ruggedness of the path he trod.</p>

<p>“I must go home and sleep, if I can; and I must
see Cliquot exercised in the morning.”</p>

<p>Thus he thought; and all night he dreamed of the
race and the woman he loved.</p>

<p>When he reached the track in the early morning,
he saw a boy run out of one of the stables, jump
into a buggy with a man and drive away.</p>

<p>“Where’s the jockey?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Just left, sir,” said the groom.</p>

<p>“Has he been here both days?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“No sir.”</p>

<p>“Why?” and Emory grew pale with anger.</p>

<p>“Peleg reported him sick, sir.”</p>

<p>“Stuff!” muttered the owner; “but I trust he’s all
right now.”</p>

<p>“I think so, sir,” said the man, “for he rode like
a major to-day.”</p>

<p>Sunday! How would he ever get through the hours?
Go to church? No! Never at the best of times did
he love the inside of a chapel, and now that it suggested
a vision of a dead woman and flowers could
he go?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[58]</span></p>

<p>Should he tell Mrs. Gwinn of his wife’s death?</p>

<p>What mattered it to her? She was now planning
to marry her daughter to a millionaire. Let Gwendoline
know? Not yet! Oh! not yet! But let him
win this race&mdash;then, then the whole world might
know, and Cassandra do her worst! What was it
that at times blanched his cheek as he thought of
her&mdash;“she who inflames with love?” Did he deem
her a dangerous woman? Perhaps. But what about
that other&mdash;“Kitty who laughs?”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Gwendoline sat before her glass, that morning, in a
blue wrapper, with her hair down. Alice Legare, her
maid, stood behind her and softly brushed out its
silken waves. It was beautiful hair, but not long&mdash;falling
only a little below her shoulders, a few tapering
coils going nearly to the waist. It grew so lovely
upon that shapely head! It is not always the wealth
of hair that is attractive. A great many women
have that; but all along the brow, around the ear
and back of the neck it went wandering away as if it
were a wave of light. And then the color&mdash;rich red
brown, the bronze you read about, the “sunset glow,”
and all that you see in the “Cenci” pictures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[59]</span></p>

<p>Alice kept brushing and toying with it; and, as
she did so, she began to think, and at last forgot to
brush. Her mistress glanced up.</p>

<p>“Crying again, Alice?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” murmured the girl. “How can I ever thank
you?”</p>

<p>“You have thanked me, Alice, more than once,
more than you know.”</p>

<p>“So little, so very little, Miss,” she said. “I would
it were more.”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” replied Gwendoline; “all may yet
be well. Why, you have grown almost pretty again;
and your hair is now quite as bright as ever. See!
it is just the color of mine, but it does not curl or
wave.”</p>

<p>“Only when I crimp it,” laughed the maid.</p>

<p>“Ah! there, that’s right! I love to see you merry.
Now, go. I can finish. I am sure mamma wants
you,” and Miss Gwinn gathered up her tresses as the
girl quitted the room.</p>

<p>“She is almost as tall as I am, and might be my
sister. How funny,” she added, “to have a maid like
that&mdash;only she isn’t half as lazy as I! Dear, dear,
how weary I am!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[60]</span></p>

<p>With a rippling laugh, she threw herself on a sofa
and put her white arms up over her head. She took
them down directly, and, pushing up her sleeves,
patted first one, then the other.</p>

<p>“Pretty good arms, pretty good arms, mon ami!”</p>

<p>Then, throwing them out before her, she exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Bon jour, Monsieur Emory&mdash;ha! ha! Now I will
dress.”</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">BACKWARDS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Sunday night, and I have three pictures to show
you.</p>

<p>First, let us glance at the open windows of Cassandra’s
reception-room. The vine-clad balcony, behind
which waved soft lace curtains, appeared cool and
inviting in the stillness of that warm, star-lit evening.
Soft rays of rosy light from shaded lamps streamed
out upon the floor.</p>

<p>Lying back in a large chair, in all the glory of
jewels and fleecy lace, was the lovely Clovis. Her
large dark eyes had a dreamy, far-away look, for she
was thinking of the one man in all the world whom
she loved. Yes, with her whole heart, her whole soul,
she loved Neil Emory.</p>

<p>Years ago, let me tell it now, she ran away from
home and married a handsome, worthless fellow, who,
when he died, left her nothing. She was of English
birth. Her mother was dead and her father married<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>
a second time. An uncle, a stage manager in America,
offered her a home, which she accepted, and, for a
long while, she was his housekeeper. She was frequently
at the theatre, occasionally assuming some
minor part in the play; but she was never considered
an actress&mdash;she was merely a “responsible lady.”</p>

<p>One day her uncle fell sick and she was compelled
to take his place. He became almost an invalid, so
it happened that for a long while she was virtually
the manager. Yet so efficiently was the business conducted
that the world never suspected the real manager
was rarely behind the scenes.</p>

<p>About that time an actress of some note was engaged
for thirty nights on her uncle’s boards. When she had
played fifteen nights, and each time to an admiring
audience, she caught a violent cold and lay dangerously
ill.</p>

<p>Now a strange thing happened. The sick actress
sent for the manager’s niece and informed her she
must take her place in the bill. There was a wonderful
resemblance between the two women; in form
and feature, hair, eyes and brow, they were alike.
The almost dying woman pleaded that she should
assume her very name and finish her engagement,<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>
urging that, as the girl had watched her performance
for fifteen nights in the wings and had even understudied
the part, she ought to be able to play it.</p>

<p>“Keep my engagement for me,” she begged, “for,
far away over the water, I have a little child dependent
on me.”</p>

<p>It would require too much space to give all the
particulars, but that night the girl walked the stage
in borrowed name and robes, and, when the curtain
fell, had achieved a triumph as an actress. Such is
the public. It paid blind tribute to her and she was
content. None knew the difference. Night after night,
she played her part, and long before the thirty days
expired the sick actress had passed away to the
unknown shore, bequeathing her name and glory to
another.</p>

<p>Thus, as Cassandra Clovis, the girl began life anew
and constantly sent to the child across the water all
she needed.</p>

<p>One night, the theatre at which she was playing
caught fire and was destroyed. In the red glare of
the flames a woman threw herself in front of Clovis
and begged to be saved. They were in a dressing-room
beneath the stage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[64]</span></p>

<p>“I cannot help you!” cried Clovis. “Look to yourself!”</p>

<p>“I am beside myself with fright!” the woman
cried.</p>

<p>Clovis seized her by the hand.</p>

<p>“Quick, then, this way!” and with difficulty they
reached the street where they were safe.</p>

<p>Clovis asked her companion where she would go,
where were her friends and home.</p>

<p>“I have neither friends nor home!” was the reply.
“He has perished in the flames! Let me go with
you!”</p>

<p>Together they went, and thus it happened that
Cassandra kept about her the woman known to the
world as “Kitty who laughs.”</p>

<p>She was seated, that Sunday night, on a low
stool, dressed in white and blue. A bowl of water,
in which were a number of beautiful flowers, stood
beside her. She was making a wreath and humming
a tune.</p>

<p>The flowers were to adorn their rooms next day,
should Cliquot win.</p>

<p>“What folly!” said Clovis. “Toss away the blossoms!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[65]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no!” said the other; “we don’t fling aside
full-blown roses, and there are no buds here!”</p>

<p>“I understand,” said the actress, and went on dreaming,
while Kitty sang an old song&mdash;“Did they Tell
Thee I was Dead, Katy Darling?”</p>

<p>Having finished the garland, she rose, and, opening
a drawer, took from it some gilt letters.</p>

<p>“I might as well fix it all now,” she said; “there
won’t be time to-morrow.”</p>

<p>She pushed a chair against the wall and began to
tack the letters on the paper. She had completed the
name “Cliquot” in gold and was busy arranging the
wreath in the shape of a horse-shoe around it when a
voice cried:</p>

<p>“Come down! come down! A most dangerous position!
I really must hold you, for I think you are
growing giddy!” and she felt two hands clasp her
waist.</p>

<p>“Let go, Reginald! I don’t like that!”</p>

<p>“But I do!”</p>

<p>Clovis looked up, angrily.</p>

<p>“Stop that child’s play!” she said. “You’re always
at it!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you are a little cross to-night,<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>
Miss Clovis?” the man asked, going over to where she
sat. “It must be that, for you’re never jealous.”</p>

<p>“Of you?”</p>

<p>“Hardly,” he muttered; “but wasn’t it saucy of
her to be sticking that (pointing to the decoration) in
your very face?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what you mean by that!” she
replied. “A lot of letters and flowers will never
bring him success!”</p>

<p>“Let us see.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried Kitty, “please don’t pun; you know it
is the lowest order of wit.”</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” replied the young man; “I
did not mean it as such.”</p>

<p>“Did you come to tell us about the race to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I can tell you of it now I am here, though
I really did not come for that. You know I am fond
of you myself after a fashion, Cassandra!” and he
gave her a bright, half-impudent look.</p>

<p>“He’s a handsome sort of a fellow, and I wish I
could have loved him!” thought the woman.</p>

<p>“Of course, you’ll both be out on the track. Everybody
is going, and there’ll be great excitement. I<span class="pagenum">[67]</span>
wish to Heaven,” he exclaimed, whirling towards
Clovis, “that you would persuade Emory to part with
that beast! He will ruin him!”</p>

<p>“I persuade him! I, indeed! Are you mad? What
influence has Cassandra Clovis over your friend that
you bid her do this thing? Oh, no!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Kitty has more?”</p>

<p>“Bah!” said the girl, shaking her mane; “he don’t
even know me!” and she laughed, yes, laughed even
longer and sweeter than usual&mdash;and the night sped on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In another part of the city I have a second picture
for you. A young man of dark complexion, magnificent
eyes, close-cut black hair, moustache the same
color, a tall slender figure as graceful as possible&mdash;altogether,
a handsome fellow&mdash;sat in the bright light
of an unshaded gas-jet, ruthlessly tearing up old letters
and throwing them into an open grate to be fired
by a match before he retired.</p>

<p>The room was intensely hot, though three windows
were opened to the floor. The furniture was ordinary,
the carpet worn. The door of a bed-room stood
open, and a bath-room beyond showed them to be a
suite, occupied by a person you have met before&mdash;Mr.
George Clayton, a young lawyer, who was a<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>
spendthrift and a gambler, a lover of the real “Cliquot”
and a gentleman born. The pretended lover of Gwendoline
was he and the real lover of Clovis he would
be should she allow it.</p>

<p>That night he was destroying all evidence of a past
folly, rending apart the tender wordings of a woman’s
pen and tossing them away as though he had never
cared a straw for them.</p>

<p>At length he reached the last note that lay at the
bottom of the box in company with the woman’s picture;
this he opened and glanced at. A slow smile
broke over his lips.</p>

<p>“A deuced handsome girl! I think I’ll keep it!”
He thought the eyes and brow lovely&mdash;who did
not?&mdash;with the brown hair brushed well back.</p>

<p>“I don’t think she’s breaking her heart, wherever
she is!” he murmured. “I’ve seen her but once since
that night, that awful night! I hope she enjoyed my
letter of dismissal. I wonder where she is?”</p>

<p>He tore the last envelope to pieces and stuffed the
picture into his coat-pocket, little dreaming how much
harm it might bring him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>About a mile outside of the city stood a blacksmith’s
shop, and near by its owner’s hut. Under a<span class="pagenum">[69]</span>
large tree, in front of the door, sat the man and his
wife, enjoying the coolness denied to those who dwelt
in mansions in the city. The woman held a bundle
on her lap, examining its contents by the faint light
which came through the open door.</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll fit?” asked she.</p>

<p>“I told the girl to do her best, bein’ as how we
couldn’t find the lad at the right time. She had
t’other pants to go by,” said Peleg, shortly. “You can’t
expect a chap to keer much how his jockey’s clothes
fits so they hangs all right.”</p>

<p>“Well!” sighed the woman, “I only hopes and prays
as they won’t turn out to be his burial clothes, as you
tells me it’s a mighty bad horse he is goin’ to ride.”</p>

<p>“It is a pretty bad ’un for them as don’t know
nothin’ about horses; but I guess this chap is all
right. You know, Mandy, some has a way wid a
critter as you can hardly account for.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so they has, so they has!” and she grew
silent, as her thoughts went back through many years.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The city’s hum grew less, and the clocks chimed
the midnight hour as the dark curtain rolled down
before the footlights of the stars&mdash;to rise again in
the glory of day.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">MONDAY.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">The eventful day had come, that day looked forward
to for over a week by all the city of
N&mdash;&mdash;. With opaline splendor, the sun rose over the
undulating suburbs and fell on spire and field. It
promised to be a little cool, for a slight breeze wafted
a few light clouds that floated high over the waking
town.</p>

<p>The race, set for two o’clock, was to be the only
one.</p>

<p>The crowd began to gather long before the appointed
time. All along the road could be seen vans and
carts of various descriptions, traveling in one direction.
Tents containing refreshments were erected and the
pool and lemonade stands open and ready for business
by noon. Throngs of ragamuffins hung on the fences,
waiting the opportunity to slip in unnoticed.</p>

<p>At one o’clock many business houses closed, and
the hacks and private carriages began to find their
way to the course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[71]</span></p>

<p>Among the vehicles, Cassandra and her inseparable
Kitty, reclining luxuriously in the shade of a dark
green-lined drag, furnished with a pair of beautiful
bay mares, drew up under a small tree near the
Judges’ stand.</p>

<p>Already the field was covered with conveyances,
and upon the grand stand there was not a vacant seat.
The part occupied by the ladies looked like a bed of
flowers and was beautiful to behold.</p>

<p>The two horses to run against the stallion were, of
course, the same black and bay, then walking in the
sunlight on a distant section of the track.</p>

<p>Emory had been in and out of the judges’ stand a
dozen times. As the bell tapped the first time, he
hurried towards his stable and met the trainer at the
door. Peleg, just outside, came towards him, followed
by the groom, who carried the boy’s saddle.</p>

<p>The stallion was in splendid condition. With pride
his master eyed his superb limbs and glossy coat.</p>

<p>Again the bell tapped, and the race-horse was led
on the track.</p>

<p>As Emory passed in front of the ladies’ stand, he
gave a fleeting glance to where a well-known blue,
lace covered parasol waved its drooping fringe before<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>
the half-revealed face, which he thought he recognized.
The soft folds of a silk dress he once admired,
with Paris gloves to match, made him almost certain
he knew where she sat.</p>

<p>Again the bell! This time two hasty taps. A
jockey in red and blue brushed by him and ran under
the judges’ stand, his saddle on his arm.</p>

<p>A crier called out the horses’ names: “Black Boy!
Bay Thomas! Cliquot!”</p>

<p>Around the pools went the sound, repeated a hundredfold:
“Black Boy! Bay Thomas!” But ever
at the name of Cliquot a yell went up and the rabble
clattered louder.</p>

<p>A few last notes from the band, a tightening of
girths and the constant tapping of the bell. At length
the three horses have turned and trotted slowly up
the quarter-stretch. Yellow and white are the colors
worn by the jockey who rides Black Boy, pink and
green those of Bay Thomas, while red and blue distinguish
Cliquot’s.</p>

<p>Cliquot was behaving well. Neil, from behind the
bell, watched him stepping softly on towards the starting
post, his jockey’s back-curls shining in the sun.
Every nerve in the owner’s body quivered, and his<span class="pagenum">[73]</span>
brain whirled to the verge of madness. Reginald Gray
had hardly dared approach him, and then only whispered
a word or two.</p>

<p>Now the red flag waves softly in the hands of the
starter as the three horses turn in their tracks. The
bay becomes a little restless and breaks beyond the
string. By the time he is brought back again, the
black sidles in an ugly way against the fence. With
his head arched, going gently up and down, champing
his bit a little, Cliquot stands, the hand of his
jockey moving back and forth under his mane. Now
and then, he slightly lifts his off foot and paws the
ground.</p>

<p>“Remarkable!” murmured Gray.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand it,” replied his companion.</p>

<p>Three or four impatient sounds from the bell, and
the jockeys have straightened themselves and made
ready for the start. A word, a lick and a click and&mdash;yes,
wonderful to relate, the flag falls! Off? Yes,
really off! Whoever saw a better go! Away they
speed, neck and neck!</p>

<p>Two mile heats! Breathless, the people lean forward
to watch them, as they grow dimmer in the
distance. Now on they come! As they near the<span class="pagenum">[74]</span>
quarter-stretch they still keep together, and pass beneath
the string in the same order. So far, it is a
beautiful race. Again they come! Men and boys
shout wildly as they see a gap, a little gap, when
they turn once more.</p>

<p>“I dare not look!” said Emory. “Reg., tell me!”</p>

<p>“The black is behind.”</p>

<p>“And the bay?”</p>

<p>Before the reply came, a flash of red went alone
under the string and the first heat was over!</p>

<p>The boy sprang from the horse and tottered against
the blacksmith, who was near at hand. The yelling,
surging crowd almost overpowered them. Neil approached
and asked if the boy was sick or hurt.</p>

<p>“Curse it!” he swore, harshly, “don’t give in,
Jack! Hold the lad up! Here, give him this!” and
he took a cup of brandy from the groom who was
about to pour it on his horse’s back and put it to
the lips of the boy, who, with a quick, low cry,
broke away, dragging the blacksmith through the
dust.</p>

<p>“Keep back!” yelled Jess. “He’s all right!”</p>

<p>The men and boys began to collect, and he could
hardly get beyond the gate leading into the field.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[75]</span></p>

<p>“Mr. Emory, keep that crowd back,” he cried
again, “or I’ll not answer for the consequences!”
and Neil, pushing here and there, assisted by the
police, dispersed the restless, curious stragglers of the
race-course.</p>

<p>Peleg threw his arm around his half-exhausted
companion and hurried him through the heat and
dust to the shade, where an old buggy stood.</p>

<p>The track swarmed with people, and a hundred
voices took up the cry:</p>

<p>“Cliquot wins! A thousand to one on Cliquot!
Going, going, going, gone!”</p>

<p>“Pool, sir? Pool, sir, on Cliquot?” and the air
was rent with the wild cries, oaths and bets on the
stallion.</p>

<p>Thirty minutes, and again the bell sounded.</p>

<p>“Stop that accursed band!” yelled a big man,
with five hundred on Bay Thomas, as that nag shot
by in a mad bolt around the track.</p>

<p>A laugh from fifty mouths greeted him, as he
went through the dust roaring like a mad lion.</p>

<p>The bell again, and once more the horses move beyond
the flag, all behaving pretty well. Cliquot’s
rider is a little pale, but sitting quite at ease in his<span class="pagenum">[76]</span>
saddle. The blacksmith walks to the starting point,
and, now and then, he and the boy speak to each
other. This time there is no trouble about the start
and they are off in a moment.</p>

<p>Round, as before, to the quarter-stretch; then, the
black drops far behind.</p>

<p>Only the two came thundering and panting on,
and, when the string is reached, neck and neck are
bay and stallion. On! together, on! How the dust
flies and the sun pours down!</p>

<p>When opposite the stand, a hundred glasses are
leveled at the horses, but not a shade of difference is
seen in the speed of the two. Now they have reached
the quarter-stretch. Bay Thomas’ rider uses his
whip fast and quick. Cliquot’s carries no lash, but,
with his slender knees pressed hard against his
horse’s sides, with lips drawn tight above the
clenched teeth, the red jockey swings around the
curve, and, as he does so, leans over and, in a clear
voice, cries:</p>

<p>“Up! up! there!”</p>

<p>Like an arrow from a bow, swifter than a flying
cloud, with heaving sides and quivering nostrils, the
beautiful stallion rushes in to victory! He has cleared<span class="pagenum">[77]</span>
the string, leaving the other far behind, and, still
galloping on, stops at length beyond the gate!</p>

<p>With difficulty his rider turns him towards the
stand. Cliquot knows he has won. Rearing slightly
and fretting a little, he is almost beyond the control
of the exhausted jockey.</p>

<p>Near the fence, inside the field, Clovis had drawn
her team, and one of the mares threw up her head
at the approach of the stallion. He caught the restless
movement, and, with a long, low, quivering neigh,
reared high in air, cleared the fence with a bound,
and dashed towards the mare, while his rider slid
from his seat into the dust.</p>

<p>In a moment twenty hands caught the horses attached
to the carriage; but Cliquot tore away, snorting
and wheeling to look back as he ran.</p>

<p>Emory, who had witnessed all, hastened forward,
and was about to lift the fallen jockey when the boy
sprang to his feet, apparently unhurt. The blacksmith,
who seemed always at hand, reached him; but, just as
they were about to walk away, the boy sank upon his
knees and covered his face with his hands.</p>

<p>“He is injured!” said Emory, who lingered by.
“Where are you hurt?” he asked, putting his hand
on the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[78]</span></p>

<p>A low moan was the only answer.</p>

<p>“Call my carriage! Quick, Peleg!” Emory said,
pointing across the field.</p>

<p>The boy did not stir or remove his hands till the
conveyance drew up, and then, as Emory took him in
his arms, he uttered a low cry and fainted, yes, fainted
dead away, and Neil struggled into the carriage with
his burden.</p>

<p>“Run for some water,” he said, turning to the man
behind him. He sped off, and when he returned the
gentleman was kneeling on the floor of the carriage,
gazing like one bereft of his senses at the still,
upturned face and its wealth of bronze-colored hair.
It was the beautiful face of Gwendoline Gwinn!</p>

<p>“Come away, for God’s sake, come away, sir, before
she recognizes you!” cried the blacksmith, pulling him
from the vehicle.</p>

<p>Emory allowed himself to be dragged out, and before
he could say a word the door was slammed and the
carriage gone.</p>

<p>“Only a faint, thank God!” thought Peleg, as he
picked up Gwendoline’s wig from where it had fallen
when she was laid in the carriage. “She shan’t know
from me that he found her out!” and he got her home
safely, as he had often done before.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“MY BEAUTIFUL! MY BEAUTIFUL!”</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Yes, Gwendoline rode the stallion, rode to victory
the colt she herself had reared. A few years
back, when her father lived, he had owned the mother
of Cliquot, and, from the time the beautiful sorrel
came into the world until that dark day when misery,
ruin and death settled on their hearts and homes, the
girl had caressed and fondled the lovely creature, who,
when old enough to mount, was, for her, as gentle as
a lamb.</p>

<p>Over the hills of the “blue grass” country together
they sped many, many miles, Cliquot and the tall,
red-haired, pale-faced girl who was daring as a boy,
reckless as an Indian, and cool and calculating beyond
her years.</p>

<p>No wonder Cliquot neighed low and quivered with
delight when her small hand crept, as of old, under his
mane, and the well-remembered “Up! up!” of his
coltish days rang in his ears, giving him the signal<span class="pagenum">[80]</span>
when to do his best, that best which he had never
done for any one but her.</p>

<p>The picture hanging in her room ever reminded
Gwendoline of those “dear departed days.” That small
rough sketch of mother and colt was taken when she
little dreamed they would ever part, or, parting, meet
again as they had done. At her father’s death, everything
was sold; and she and her mother left the place
they loved so well to seek a home in a city in another
state, where she again met the horse and the man she
loved.</p>

<p>By a strange fatality Emory had bought the creature,
knowing nothing of his history. By the new name
given him Gwendoline did not recognize her old
“Notos” till she saw him led up on the track that
dreadful day.</p>

<p>That night she woke from a wild and vivid dream
of once more being seated on his back like a boy,
firm and erect. She dreamed that, in scarlet jacket
and jockey cap, she rode the race and won, gaining
for the man who had been blind to the idolatry of
years victory and a purse of gold. Then and there she
seized the idea. She felt that her influence over that
trembling, high-spirited steed would be as strong as in
the olden days.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[81]</span></p>

<p>“Oh!” she murmured, “if I could but touch him!
If I could but feel once more his bounding, quivering
limbs beneath my own! For that alone I would risk
my life, my beautiful! My beautiful!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The blacksmith, Jess Peleg, who had lived on her
father’s place, had moved with them and set up his
forge just outside the city limits. Here Gwendoline
often stopped in her carriage to exchange kindly greetings.</p>

<p>When a little girl, she had stood for hours, watching
him at his work, while the light from the glowing
coals shone on her face and hair. Sometimes, in
the twilight, the man would turn to gaze upon her,
as she lingered near; and, in the imperfect light, he
would fancy it was the face of an angel. Strange
that he alone should see the coming beauty so deeply
hidden to all others who knew her!</p>

<p>Peleg had a little niece, whom, with his whole
heart, the rough fellow loved, for she was his dead
sister’s child.</p>

<p>Her father had gone to sea and left her with him
and his wife, who lived in a cottage by the forge.
There the “lady’s child” and the “laborer’s joy”<span class="pagenum">[82]</span>
grew fond of one another and Gwendoline taught the
little Alice to read and sew and perform many other
tasks.</p>

<p>One day a handsome race-rider saw Alice, took a
fancy to her, and, after awhile, persuaded her to run
away with him, because the blacksmith, having heard
he was a married man, forbade all intercourse between
him and Alice.</p>

<p>And this is why Peleg grieved sorely and pined at
his work.</p>

<p>But the red-haired girl remained his friend, and,
after a long, troublesome time, found poor Alice and
brought her home. Her husband by this time had
deserted her, leaving her lonely and broken-hearted.
So grateful were both the blacksmith and his niece
that, when Gwendoline took the girl to be her maid,
her uncle followed, to be near them in the city of
N&mdash;&mdash;; and, when Gwendoline was fired with the
thought of her daring scheme, it was Peleg who
aided her and Alice who saw her to and from the
shop, and, at last, on the day of the race, sat amid
the ladies on the stand, dressed in her mistress’
clothes, sporting her gloves and her parasol, and, with
a veil over her face, was a silent witness of her lady’s
triumph.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[83]</span></p>

<p>And this man, Neil Emory, is married. She knows
he is bound to another. Why has she done this for
him? Can it be for love?</p>

<p>Yes! for love her hands guided his flying steed to
the mine of wealth. For love her “pretty good arms”
held in check the reins of fortune, only to slacken
them when the prize was won.</p>

<p>Now she lay back amid her pillows at ease and
laughed at the world and her mother, who called her
“lazy.”</p>

<p>Where is her energy now? Gone? No! oh, no!
but she can be quite as lazy as ever now, and so
the beautiful, tall, supple girl stretches out her graceful
limbs on the downy couch, with the same ease
that the racer does his on the greensward.</p>

<p>“How glad I am that he does not know!” she
thought. She was not aware Neil had discovered her,
for, when she opened her eyes in the carriage,
Peleg alone was with her; and, when they drew up
before the blacksmith’s cottage, her hair was again
under her black wig, and she was able to alight and
enter, leaving him to return thanks by the driver.</p>

<p>She was lying on the little bed in the back room
of this humble home when Alice appeared with her<span class="pagenum">[84]</span>
garments, as usual. Her carriage stood a short distance
off, under some trees, and it was not long before
she appeared in her own dress, looking tall and
stately, and, with her faithful maid, drove home,
through the gloom.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gwinn had not gone to the race. She never
attended races; in fact, she had preferred to spend
the day with a friend.</p>

<p>When Gwendoline entered her own room, she
walked over to where the picture of the stallion
hung. Taking it down, she pressed it to her bosom,
saying:</p>

<p>“God bless you, my darling! God bless you, my
beautiful! You never ran like that before&mdash;and may
never do so again!”</p>

<p>Then, with Alice’s assistance, she undressed, and,
after a refreshing warm bath, wrapped about her a
long, cool, white robe and threw herself on a low
couch, saying softly over and over, as the pent up
tears fell slowly down her cheeks:</p>

<p>“For thee I did it&mdash;for thee! Farewell, my beautiful!
my beautiful!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">THE CHINK OF GOLD.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When the carriage containing Gwendoline and
her companion had passed the outer gate,
Neil Emory started forward like one mad, and hastened
towards the highway.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” said a voice, and a hand
was laid on his arm.</p>

<p>“Hail that carriage!” he shouted, without looking
round. But it was far beyond the reach of human
voice. Then he gazed about him and saw his friend
Gray at his elbow.</p>

<p>“I’ve been watching you,” said he, “and I saw you
put the boy in the carriage. I dare say he’s all right.
Peleg is a pretty good fellow, and he’s well-known
on the track. Only a faint, was it? You ought to
be glad the buck wasn’t killed. Come!” and he
slipped his arm in his friend’s. “I see they’ve caught
Cliquot; but the rascal is neighing and plunging worse
than ever. I say, Emory!” as they walked on, “he’s<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>
brought you in a tremendous pile, but, if you don’t
secure the services of that last jockey, you’d better
part with the animal!”</p>

<p>Part with Cliquot! The words rang in his ears.
Part with him now? Not for ten thousand worlds!
Not for ten million jockeys! Had she not ridden him?
Thank God! no one but himself knew. No one saw
the sweet face of his love beneath the dark hair and
scarlet cap. His alone the secret denied even to her.
He would hug it, with that other, to his breast, and
overpower her in his joy! Soon, ah! how soon might
it, could it be?</p>

<p>Half-dazed and bewildered, he walked to the stand.
The excitement was nearly over. Bets were being
settled, and the pool-rooms were empty. As he came
up, many hands grasped his and handkerchiefs waved,
and kisses were thrown from the women above.</p>

<p>They were putting Clovis’ mares back into the carriage,
and she was preparing to leave. She raised her
veil, and turned her dark eyes upon him&mdash;those beautiful
orbs so full of fire usually, now so filled with
the tender light of love for him. Can he resist them,
even at this moment when his own heart is stirred
with a passion which well nigh stops its beating?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[87]</span></p>

<p>He raised his hat, went over to where she sat, and,
taking her outstretched hand in his, said:</p>

<p>“I feel that I have your congratulations.”</p>

<p>“You have, indeed,” she whispered; “and&mdash;and&mdash;the
boy?&mdash;he was not hurt?”</p>

<p>“No! thank God!” How hoarse and low his voice
sounded; and the woman at his side saw what he did
not&mdash;a tear fall on the ungloved hand that went up
to her veil as he walked away.</p>

<p>Gray met him on the road to his stable.</p>

<p>“The heaviest loser here to-day is Clayton,” he
said. “I never saw a more upset man. Of course,
he swears there was foul play and is making himself
generally disagreeable. He has been drinking champagne
by the quart for days. Last night he was up
with Bob and others till a late hour. I went to his
rooms about midnight and found them. A blaze was
dancing up the grate, where he was destroying some
old love letters. I got Bob home, for I knew Selina
wouldn’t like to hear of it. The others kept it up;
and to-day the same party have had ice and wine for
hours in the reception-rooms. I hope you won’t have
any trouble with him, Neil. I should not like you
to meet him just now, for the sake of&mdash;&mdash;well, for a
good many reasons,” he concluded, hastily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[88]</span></p>

<p>“Never fear,” said his companion, with a smile.
Ah! that slow, beautiful smile that had won him so
many women’s hearts.</p>

<p>A couple of grooms were busy scraping and rubbing
down his horse, which, in no very amiable mood,
was having his jaws forced open by the wet sponge
and the sweat cleaned from his sides.</p>

<p>“Did he hurt either of the mares, or frighten the
ladies much?” Neil inquired.</p>

<p>“He made one of the mares break a trace, and
gave her a pretty good lick on the shoulder, that’ll
make her limp awhile; but the ladies, sir!&mdash;they
behaved finely&mdash;we quite admired them. Be quiet
there!” he called, as Cliquot kicked out, just missing
the man’s arm. “I declare, Mr. Emory, it’s as much
as one’s life is worth to groom such a horse as this.”</p>

<p>“Well! so it is&mdash;there! that’s for your risk; something
extra,” and he handed him a five-dollar gold-piece.
“Take lots of care of him, my man,” he called
out as he departed.</p>

<p>“What extravagance!” exclaimed Reginald.</p>

<p>“That’s my mood, just at present,” and Neil laughed.</p>

<p>Reginald was right in thinking George Clayton would
give Emory some trouble if they met. Like all cowards,<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>
he was a dangerous fellow when aroused by wine.
His dark, handsome face looked like a demon’s, as he
came out of the pool-room, holding his hat in one
hand, while he ran the other back and forth through
his hair, and swung his long limbs across the track.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so loudly,” said one of his friends;
“there’s Emory!”</p>

<p>“Just what I want,” cried the young man, in a
violent manner, going up to where Neil stood, waiting
for a hack to take his friend and himself home.</p>

<p>Neil had turned at the sound of his name, and now,
with his cool, calm face, confronted the speaker, whose
visage was inflamed by passion and wine.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, “what do you want?”</p>

<p>“A settlement of this infernal business!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” and the blond man straightened
himself a trifle.</p>

<p>“I mean, Mr. Emory,” and he leaned over and
shouted the words in his ear, “the way your cursed
jockey rode! I call it&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>A cloud of dust and a falling, bleeding man, with
his lip cut open, were all the spectators saw. There
was a cry of, “For God’s sake, Emory, enough!
enough!” and Reginald, with some of his friends, hurried<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>
him away, while the dust-covered, blood-stained
face of Clayton was shut out from their view by the
crowd.</p>

<p>The hack drove up, and Emory and his friend made
their way to it. Not a word was spoken, and in
silence they returned to the city.</p>

<p>The sun was low in the horizon and the lights in
the streets began to glitter as they reached home.</p>

<p>“I wish I’d killed him,” said Neil, “so it would all
be over!”</p>

<p>“Do you think he’ll fight?” asked Gray.</p>

<p>“Yes,” responded Emory, “when he gets intoxicated
again.”</p>

<p>“Oh! by the bye, old fellow, here’s a photo I picked
up from the ground. Does it happen to belong to
you?” and Gray took from his pocket the picture
that Clayton had thrust into his the night before, and
handed it to Emory.</p>

<p>One glance, one swift, penetrating glance, and he
knew her.</p>

<p>This then was the man for whom she had left
him! This was the cur who had escaped him!
Would no peace come for him? Was his life ever
to be one of dramatic disclosures and startling episodes?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[91]</span></p>

<p>“Reginald,” he asked, “don’t you know her?” and
he held the picture under the gaslight, as they stood
in the room.</p>

<p>“Your wife!” and the staring eyes of his friend
met his.</p>

<p>“Yes, Reg.,&mdash;and&mdash;I didn’t kill him! It came from
his pocket. I saw it fall, with some papers, when I
caught hold of his coat and held him as I cut his
accursed lip open.”</p>

<p>He went over to the window to hide his face, and
a dead one rose before him.</p>

<p>“Shall I tell him?” he thought. Yes, he would;
for in time all would know. Going back to the table,
where he had thrown the picture, he took it up, and,
turning to his friend, said, simply:</p>

<p>“She is dead, Reginald, and&mdash;I forgive her. Leave
me, old boy, I would be alone.” And the door soon
closed behind departing footsteps.</p>

<p>Alone with his thoughts, he folded his arms in his
old way, and walked up and down the long room.
Once, as he passed before a handsome sideboard, he
stopped, and, taking a decanter of brandy from a shelf,
poured some into a tumbler and drank it.</p>

<p>“My first drink in an age!” he thought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[92]</span></p>

<p>The strong liquor stirred his cold and stagnant blood,
and soon a glow showed itself on his cheeks.</p>

<p>“I needed it,” he thought; “my very heart was
getting chilled.”</p>

<p>He rang the bell for his servant, who, when he
came, was told to order a supper sent from a restaurant.</p>

<p>“I cannot face a crowd&mdash;no, not to-night. I must
think and be alone, and sleep if I can.”</p>

<p>So he waited for his solitary repast.</p>

<p>Having partaken of it and dismissed his servant
for the night, he turned off the hot and flaring gas,
opened the door of his sleeping apartment, that the
light might shine from beyond, and, drawing a chair
to the large window, pushed back the hanging curtains
so the breeze might fan his cheek and brow as
he sat in the gloom.</p>

<p>No doubt, the wish to rush forth to where his love
lay slumbering the hours away was strong within
him; he, however, yielded not to it, but thought:</p>

<p>“Not yet, not yet will I disturb the halo that
encircles her. Let the days speed by, and the nights,
though but a few, waft their bright and fluttering
pinions over us a little longer. I would not startle<span class="pagenum">[93]</span>
thee, oh, my darling, in this hour. How careful must
I be, as I unfold to her my knowledge.”</p>

<p>Thoughts like these, half-spoken to the midnight
air came thick and fast; then others crowded on his
brain.</p>

<p>He knew that the Gwinn’s were poor. Money!
Was it for the reward&mdash;two thousand dollars?&mdash;and
he must pay it&mdash;to her!</p>

<p>“No, no!” he cried aloud, springing to his feet,
and pacing the room as before. “I know not what to
think, what to do!” And thus, his mind torn by a
thousand contending feelings, he passed the hours till
dawn.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">FALSE COURAGE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">Emory was finishing his toilet the next morning
when his servant knocked at the door, and, on
entering, informed him that a man, giving his name
as Jess Peleg, was waiting in the ante-room to see
him. Emory soon joined him, and, leading him into
the reception-hall, motioned Peleg to a seat.</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir, I won’t sit down. I’ve but a
few words to say, if I only knew how to put them
up. I never was much of a talker, and I guess I’d
as well come to the point at once.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said Emory, opening a desk behind
him and drawing a check book towards him, as he
dipped his pen in the ink. “You remember, it was
two thousand dollars; and here is the check made
out in your name.”</p>

<p>The man took it, saying:</p>

<p>“Yes; and here it is in no name!” and he tore the
paper into pieces and scattered them on the floor.<span class="pagenum">[95]</span>
“I didn’t come for no pay, Mr. Emory, I only is
here to ask that you keep to yourself what you
found out yesterday. I wouldn’t tell her for the
world; anyhow, sir, not yet awhile. She has her own
reason, bless her heart, for the ride she took. I
might as well make a ‘up and up’ of it, sir, for fear
you’d be gettin’ things wrong. You know&mdash;if I tell
you so&mdash;that she raised that stallion herself. The
mother belonged to her father, and I was the blacksmith
on the place. So you see it weren’t no great
things for her to do, considering as how the horse
knowed her so well, and them sort is always gentle
like with a woman. I’ve been raised in the ‘blue
grass’ country and so has she, and what we don’t know
about a daisy cutter, ain’t worth knowing. She come
to me, just after she found out your jockey was dead,
saying she knowed your stallion was her old Notos,
and says she:</p>

<p>“‘Peleg, I can ride him! Peleg, I can’t abide for
him to be beat! I feel, old fellow, as if I must kick
off my satins and silks, and get astride of my darling
again. Oh! I thought he was dead and gone forever!
When I saw him come on the track that day, I
wanted to go down and kiss him as I used to do!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[96]</span></p>

<p>“And then she just begged me to help her do
what she did. I was not afraid of her gettin’ hurt,
but found out. I don’t know if she had any other
reason than just to be on his back, and run him, as
I used to see her do, a comin’ down the pretty roads
of our old home, her bright hair a-flyin’ behind her.
I don’t know if that were the only reason; but she
pleaded, with the tears in her eyes, for my help to
win your race, sir! And now please keep your
money and our secret.”</p>

<p>He took up his hat, and without another word
bowed low to his listener, whom he left dumb-founded.</p>

<p>Keep her secret? Yes, that he would; but how
long? But would she keep it herself? Had she not
already revealed it to him whom she believed forever
lost to her?</p>

<p>Afar off in her rosy bower that breezy morn Gwendoline
thought of him, and her cheek grew paler at
the idea that he might have discovered her. No
word or look, as yet, had betrayed her passionate
love for him. The color rushed over throat and brow,
as she thought of what she had braved for him. To
give to the husband of another her heart’s best treasure<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>
was terrible in itself; and hide it in her bosom as
she would, she failed to still those wailings, which
had he heard them would horrify him. And then to
know her as she was, unsexed before his very eyes,
that, that would be the finishing stroke. That she
thought in her despair would deal her a death-blow.</p>

<p>So thought Gwendoline. She murmured a prayer of
thankfulness, and blessed the brawny blacksmith, the
friend of her childhood, who, she believed, had saved
her from this disgrace.</p>

<p>In the meantime, while these two hearts were torn
with such contending emotions, the men at the clubs
were discussing the race and its excitement. The
wonderful pluck and bravery of the young jockey
were touched upon, his grace and good riding praised,
but the culminating incident of the encounter between
Emory and Clayton was the principal theme of conversation.</p>

<p>Would he resent the blow? Could he easily forget
so ignoble a fall in the dust, before a throng of men
and women? Had he any excuse to plead for such
coarse and ungentlemanly conduct?</p>

<p>Many and varied were the comments around the
card tables, in the reading-rooms and over the billiard<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>
cues. During four or five days following the
race, little else was talked of, friends on both sides
being anxious to arrange matters amicably.</p>

<p>“Don’t trouble yourselves, my dear fellows!” said
Emory on the third evening, as he made his first
appearance among them since the race. “I think
Mr. Clayton and I perfectly understand each other. I
sent him a letter this morning, which will be answered
from&mdash;&mdash;New York!”</p>

<p>A smile went around the company.</p>

<p>“Oh! pray don’t think for a moment that I am
speaking derogatorily of the gentleman in question,
for I assure you I intend nothing of the kind. On
the contrary, I highly appreciate his many and untold
perfections. Still, I think it altogether unnecessary
that you feel further anxiety on this subject. It has
quite settled itself&mdash;quite. Thanks, all the same.”
And, taking his hat from the rack, Neil bowed
politely and left the club.</p>

<p>“Well!” exclaimed one, “so there won’t be any
duel, after all!”</p>

<p>“No! for I doubt if Clayton has the wherewithal
to buy his false courage!” chimed in another.</p>

<p>“I say, Reginald!” said a slim young fellow, buttonholing<span class="pagenum">[99]</span>
him and drawing him towards an open
window, “I have heard that Emory is a married man.
Is there any truth in the report?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” replied Gray; “but&mdash;&mdash;he has lost his
wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I beg pardon! You are great friends, are
you not? He’s an awfully fine fellow, and all that.
I did not ask from idle curiosity. My sister and
myself are great admirers of his, and, somehow, I
didn’t like to think of him as sailing under false
colors.”</p>

<p>“All right, Maury; I understand, and if you’ll
just step outside, on the balcony here, I’ll light a
cigar and give you a little history.”</p>

<p>They took two chairs and made themselves comfortable.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Gray, leaning back and knocking
the ashes from his cigar, and, as he did so, wondering
how much he ought to tell, “you see, he was
married four or five years ago to Cecile Davis, a
cousin of Miss Gwinn. Everybody thought it a love
match; but I always doubted it and wasn’t the least
bit surprised when she ran away.”</p>

<p>“Left him!” cried Maury, starting forward. “Why,<span class="pagenum">[100]</span>
what was the woman made of to desert such a man
as that?”</p>

<p>A shrug of the shoulders was Gray’s only reply, and
he continued:</p>

<p>“Well, he has never seen her since. Not long ago
he heard she was dead. I wouldn’t speak of the matter
generally, Maury, for I really think it too delicate
a subject to be discussed in clubs; don’t you agree
with me?”</p>

<p>“I really do. Perhaps there is some one else he
cares for. I wonder if it’s the actress?”</p>

<p>“No!” was the answer, “I do not think it is
Clovis.”</p>

<p>“Emory is a fine fellow!” exclaimed Maury, “and,
if Selina wasn’t engaged to Bob, I’d rather see her
fancy him than anybody I know. But it’s late! and
my speaking of my sister reminds me that I promised
to call for her at Mrs. Dale’s where she is taking tea.
By the by,” he added, as they came down the steps
of the club together, “are you going to the garden
party at Mrs. Dale’s country place? Of course, you
were invited?”</p>

<p>“I dare say I’ll put in an appearance,” answered
Gray, “since it’s getting too hot for dancing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[101]</span></p>

<p>“Oh! but they will dance out there,” said Maury,
“and in the open air, too.”</p>

<p>“Well! when I happen to hear a good band I generally
feel inclined to take a step or two,” remarked
Gray. “I am not a bit like Neil in that respect; he
thinks it an awful waste of time.”</p>

<p>“But we’ll see him, at any rate; don’t you think so?
And, Gray,” added Maury, as they reached the corner
where their paths diverged, “I wish you would ask
Emory to allow me to drive him out behind my team.
I heard he sent his horses back to his place to-day.
I’m rather proud of those bays of mine and want his
opinion on their merits, as well as his agreeable company.
Tell him, will you? And ask him to send a
reply in the morning.”</p>

<p>“Very well; no doubt he will be delighted,” and
the two parted.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">A MOONLIGHT DRIVE.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">When Emory stepped into Maury’s buggy to
drive the three or four miles into the country
to Mrs. Dale’s summer home, he doubted not that he
would see Gwendoline there. They had not met since
the day Cliquot won. To say he carried a calm heart
and easy mind would not be true; and, as they neared
the festive scene, he almost longed to turn his face
homeward. They had started after an early dinner,
and when they arrived most of the guests had already
been several hours in the beautiful grounds, gay with
both natural and artificial bowers. Cloths stretched
for dancing, lawn tennis nets, showing their whiteness
against the green, and Chinese lanterns of every description
hanging ready to be lighted were in every
direction. A few tents were pitched here and there,
and the sweet strains of an Italian band filled the
air.</p>

<p>During their drive out Maury endeavored in every<span class="pagenum">[103]</span>
way to make himself agreeable to his companion,
whom he found strangely silent on that beautiful afternoon.
Finally as a last resort he began to talk of his
horses, launching out most eloquently.</p>

<p>“You see, my father gave them to me,” said he.
“I think they are beauties. He bought them several
years ago at a sale in Kentucky. A wealthy man
died, and all his possessions were sold. They have a
good pedigree, but I don’t know their real names, so
my boy just calls them what he pleases. They don’t
exactly match in color; one is a brown and the other
a blood bay; but their action is perfect.”</p>

<p>“Where did your father buy them?” asked Emory,
at last a little interested.</p>

<p>“From a gentleman named Gwinn. I wonder if he
was any relation to our Miss Gwinn? I have heard
that she came from the same State.”</p>

<p>“I think it very likely. Suppose you ask her;
perhaps she can enlighten you in regard to your
horses’ names.”</p>

<p>“By Joe, I will!” exclaimed Maury. “Ah! here
we are! How lovely everything looks!”</p>

<p>They turned into the long drive; their horses were
taken away and they were soon amid the scene I have<span class="pagenum">[104]</span>
already described after meeting their hostess. Maury
went off in search of his sister.</p>

<p>“Where’s Bob?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I am sure I don’t know,” replied her brother.
“Hasn’t he been here all day? I have only just
arrived. Tell me who are here.”</p>

<p>“Everybody, Clovis included. I don’t know why
Mrs. Dale asked her.”</p>

<p>“She is very agreeable, even off the stage,” said
Maury, “and there’s nothing against her coming among
us.”</p>

<p>“They have been playing lawn tennis, and all that
nonsense,” went on the girl. “I hate it and I wish
they would not bother me to play!”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think you are a little cross, Selina?”
her brother asked.</p>

<p>Just then some young men came up and he was
glad to get away. It was an hour or so before he
found Gwendoline.</p>

<p>At last he espied her, seated beneath a bower of
roses and swinging lanterns, the sun trying to peep at
her through the leaves. Two or three young men, in
tennis costumes, were collected around her, and one
lay on the grass at her feet, playing with his bat.<span class="pagenum">[105]</span>
She, too, wore a tennis costume, for she belonged to a
club and played. It was the one thing she would do
that her mother disapproved of.</p>

<p>She must, at times, shake off those everlasting silks
and laces, along with her apparent indolence, and race
on foot with bat and ball.</p>

<p>Her suit was a close-fitting skirt and a jacket,
trimmed with red, with cap to match. “Much like
the jockey’s,” she thought, as she donned it, that
morning, before the glass. She made a lovely picture,
against a background of green, as she reclined in a
garden seat and sipped an ice. The brilliant trimming
of her dress enhanced the glory of her hair and contrasted
with the whiteness of her skin.</p>

<p>“Oh! Miss Gwendoline, I’ve been hunting you
everywhere! You know my horses? I’ve just been
told that they might have once belonged to your
father; and you, perhaps, can tell me their names,”
and Maury took a seat beside her.</p>

<p>“Yes! they did belong to my father, and their names
are Castor and Pollux.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! and to think I never knew it before!
What lovely names!&mdash;and my boy has been calling
them Dandy and Jack all this time. Why didn’t you<span class="pagenum">[106]</span>
correct me, when I called them by those names?” he
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Because”&mdash;and she stooped over to swallow the
last of her ice&mdash;“I never meddle with other people’s
affairs!”</p>

<p>“Never?”</p>

<p>She looked up quickly. Neil stood before her in a
close-fitting, dark blue Norfolk suit, with a curious
smile upon his lips. She grew deadly pale, and her
eyes dropped before his for the first time. He must
have felt a little for her, for, when he spoke again, his
voice trembled somewhat. As he relieved her of the
empty saucer in her lap, he said:</p>

<p>“Ices always make me so cold. Do you think it
a healthy thing to do&mdash;play tennis and eat frozen
cream?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she laughed.</p>

<p>And then he turned and left her.</p>

<p>“I won’t worry her any more,” he thought.</p>

<p>He did not go near her again, but wandered about
in an aimless way until he came across Clovis, talking
with a crowd of men. He felt too dull and out
of sorts to be entertained by her then, but paused to
shake hands across a table of refreshments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[107]</span></p>

<p>“Are you coming to see the last of me?” she
asked. “You know it is my third week, and we are
going away then.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I will be there to-morrow night,” and he
was gone.</p>

<p>Did he know what he would do then? Would
that the veil might have been lifted and he could
have gazed, if but for a moment, on the drama fate
was even now preparing for him, to be enacted the
next night.</p>

<p>Slowly passing beneath the overhanging boughs,
with head erect, he pauses; while the lights from the
lanterns, shining forth through the early twilight, fall
on him, he dreams alone. Think of him thus, oh,
reader! and know that after to-morrow night there
will be a shadow cast upon his life.</p>

<p>Some one called him&mdash;some one touched his arm,
and, turning, he beheld Maury.</p>

<p>“Emory,” said Maury, “I am going to ask a favor
of you. Miss Gwinn is willing for me to drive her
home, should her mother consent. She knows the
horses, and all that. Gray has a vacant seat for you
in his drag. You won’t mind accepting it, will you,
and let me take Miss Gwinn? I’d do as much for
you, any day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[108]</span></p>

<p>Neil remembered the eyes that drooped beneath his
own, and he didn’t mind in the least. She was quite
safe, he thought.</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Gwendoline, “I am going to drive
home with Mr. Maury.”</p>

<p>“Impossible!” replied the lady; “you know I
never allow you to drive with young men, especially
behind strange horses.”</p>

<p>The girl leaned over and whispered something in
her mother’s ear.</p>

<p>“That alters the case, as far as the horses are concerned.”</p>

<p>“Come, come, now, Mrs. Gwinn,” said the young
man, approaching, “don’t deny your daughter the
pleasure of once more riding behind her own nags;
and, you know, I am to be trusted.”</p>

<p>“Quite true, my dear youth!&mdash;but how am I to
explain matters to others?”</p>

<p>“Oh! just say she’s going to be a bridesmaid to
my sister, and we want to talk about her dress.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gwinn laughed.</p>

<p>“Well! I suppose I am overruled by that wonderful
argument&mdash;but, Gwendoline!” and she called her
daughter to her side, as Maury went to order his<span class="pagenum">[109]</span>
team&mdash;“be at home on time; remember your engagement
with Col. Coutell.”</p>

<p>“I will be there at the appointed hour,” murmured
the girl, looking through the gloom. She went with
her mother to bid their hostess adieu; and, leaving
her to accompany some friends home, she put her
hand in Maury’s and got into the buggy that awaited
her.</p>

<p>There were two exits to the grounds, and through
that nearest to the city the carriages and other conveyances
were driving.</p>

<p>“Go out by the lower gate,” said Gwendoline; “I
have something to show you.”</p>

<p>Quite willing to take the longer route, Maury
turned his horses’ heads and softly trotted them down
the rather lonely drive. It became very lonely ere
they reached the end; the overhanging boughs
touched their cheeks as they drove along this disused
pathway. The lights shone in the distance, and the
dying strains of the band were faintly heard as they
drew up at the gate.</p>

<p>“Stop!” said the lady beside him; “let me open
it!” and, before he could prevent her, she had sprung
lightly from the vehicle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[110]</span></p>

<p>She stood for a moment, looking at him in the
imperfect light.</p>

<p>“Do you want to hear some sweet music?” she
asked.</p>

<p>“I have heard it all the way from the house to
this place,” he said, gallantly.</p>

<p>“Nay, listen!” and she stepped to the heads of the
horses, ran her hand lightly over their faces and
softly called them by name.</p>

<p>A low, quivering neigh answered her.</p>

<p>“They know you,” said Maury; “how sweetly it
sounds!”</p>

<p>She quickly opened the gate, and he drove through.
It shut with a clang behind them, and he was about
to get out to help her in, when she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Never do that! Always remain seated to take
care of the horses. You can assist me quite as well
from where you sit.”</p>

<p>“But I thought you knew my steeds and were not
afraid of them?”</p>

<p>“Nor am I; but do as I tell you; my father
taught me that it was right.”</p>

<p>So saying, she was beside him in a moment, and
they drove out into the open moonlight. Yes! the<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>
queen of night rode high above them, shedding her
lustre upon the white turnpike that lay before them,
like a sheet of snow. Long years after, they remembered
that ride&mdash;the flowery lanes and sweet night
breeze. She was happy with this slim, bright boy.
His gay talk and laughter amused her. No care for
the morrow filled her heart. She pulled off her
tennis cap to catch the winds of heaven upon her
brow, and, as they sped on, the mellow ringing sound
of those eight hoofs upon the road reminded her of
her old home.</p>

<p>When they had gone about a mile, she turned to
him and said:</p>

<p>“Have you a pocket knife?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Will you do me a favor?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I will do anything in the world for you to-night!”
he whispered, now thoroughly in love with the beautiful
woman beside him.</p>

<p>“Stop the horses. Now, get down and cut those
blinds off, and I’ll show you something.”</p>

<p>He obeyed at once, tossing the leathers on the
road. When he was in his seat again, she took the
reins and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[112]</span></p>

<p>“Wait till I get to a wider place. Ah, here is
one!”</p>

<p>Dropping the ribbons across the dashboard, she
took out her handkerchief and waved it to the right,
seeing which the horses turned slowly and trotted
back the way they had come. Another wave to the
left; they obeyed as before, and were homeward
bound. “Halt!” she cried, and they stood like things
of stone at the sound of her voice.</p>

<p>“My father taught them that! Now, take the reins;
you may need them in the city. I see the lights
ahead.”</p>

<p>The horses’ hoofs soon sounded upon the city streets
and, when he left her, he went home to dreams such
as he had never dreamed before.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“I KNOW YOU, GWENDOLINE.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">“To-morrow night!” The theatre was packed.
It was a benefit&mdash;Clovis’ last performance.
All N&mdash;&mdash; shone forth in its best array to bid farewell,
for at least a season, to a woman who had won
from many much applause&mdash;&mdash;perhaps, from a few,
some real love. The right proscenium box was occupied
by Mrs. Gwinn, her daughter, Mrs. Dale, Col.
Coutell and another gentleman. Gwendoline sat in the
shadow of a curtain. She wore a soft black lace,
relieved by a bunch of crimson verbenas on the low
corsage, their sweet leaves touching her white neck.</p>

<p>Emory was met on the stairway by the usher.</p>

<p>“There’s not a seat to be had in the house,” he
said; “but if the party who engaged the left hand box
don’t come by the second act, I’ll show you in
there, sir.”</p>

<p>He stood through the act, but, when the curtain
went down, the usher came to him, saying:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[114]</span></p>

<p>“We have just learned that the people who engaged
the box are not coming; so it’s yours, sir, for the
night.”</p>

<p>When he had taken his seat, he raised his opera-glass
and sought for the woman he loved. At last,
he found her! How beautiful she looked that night!
He had never seen her dressed in that way before.
Her lovely arms shone like alabaster on the velvet
cushions near her. Again and again he gazed.</p>

<p>“I must go to her,” he said to himself, “if but to
touch her dress!” and, when the curtain fell a second
time, he knocked at the door of her box. She started
slightly as he came in and took a seat beside her.</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy your drive?”</p>

<p>“Oh! so much!”</p>

<p>“And the horses?” he asked; “how did they
go?”</p>

<p>“As usual&mdash;oh!” and she caught her breath. “I
never thought how they went, I was enjoying it all
so much!”</p>

<p>“As usual,” he said, smiling down upon her.</p>

<p>This restlessness of hers was something new to him.
The play went on; he neither saw nor heard&mdash;but
one vision was before him&mdash;Gwendoline! That beautiful<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>
head, those wondrous eyes, that white neck, those
shapely arms, that perfect form of which he had seen
the outlines beneath the flimsy covering of a boy’s
suit&mdash;those charms would drive him mad!</p>

<p>The raging fire of a long pent up passion was
consuming him as he gazed upon her. And, as one
in a wild and vivid dream, he gazed; the yearning to
take her unto himself was overpowering&mdash;the desire
to hold to his heart that soft, white, heaving breast
and feel the quivering of that beautiful form which
had bestrode Cliquot.</p>

<p>The air around became hushed and close, and a
choking sensation filled his throat. Her white,
ungloved hands lay like snowflakes in her lap. He
touched them and whispered:</p>

<p>“Let me see them!”</p>

<p>She held them up a little.</p>

<p>“God bless those hands!” he said, hoarsely.</p>

<p>She drew back behind the curtains. The orchestra
was playing&mdash;it was between the acts.</p>

<p>“Gwendoline!” he said, “I thank you!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” and her frightened eyes
met his.</p>

<p>“Draw your chair back.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[116]</span></p>

<p>She did so.</p>

<p>“My darling! I thank you in&mdash;&mdash;Cliquot’s name!”</p>

<p>What had he said that the verbenas on her neck
looked so pale? At that moment there was a slight
noise from behind the stage, and in a little while the
manager stepped out in front of the curtain and
addressed the audience as follows:</p>

<p>“I crave your indulgence for a few moments, as
one of the actresses has met with a slight accident.
It will delay matters but a short time.”</p>

<p>“Mamma,” said Gwendoline, “I should like to go
home.”</p>

<p>“Are you not well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes!” hurriedly replied her daughter; “but
I am tired.”</p>

<p>“I dislike to have you pass through the theatre
before the play is over&mdash;to-night especially when
Clovis bids farewell.”</p>

<p>“Pray, Madam,” said Emory, “allow me to escort
your daughter home. Fortunately, this is the stage
box and I can take her out that way,” pointing to
the stage door, “and easily obtain a hack. Indeed, if
agreeable, I will immediately order one to be at the
stairs when we come out.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[117]</span></p>

<p>“What say you, Col. Coutell?” and Mrs. Gwinn
turned to that gentleman, who, being deeply interested
in the play, gave his consent; and Emory hastened
away to have his orders executed. The curtain was
still down, when, with Gwendoline, trembling upon his
arm, he closed the door of communication behind
them, and stepped into the space beyond the wings.
Only a few actors and supernumeraries were about,
but, as they made their way along some stage paraphernalia
they came directly up to the woman who
was hurt. She was sitting upon a box with a silk
handkerchief over her head. She heard them, and,
pushing the hair from her face, looked up. The
bright light from the wings shone full upon her, and
they saw on her white brow a gaping cut above the
eyes.</p>

<p>“You!” cried Emory, catching wildly at his throat,
“you!”</p>

<p>“Cecile! and do you know me?”</p>

<p>“Oh! yes; I know you, Gwendoline,&mdash;and how well
you ride!”</p>

<p>A random shot, but it told, for her cousin shrank
back with the same low moan Emory had heard on
the race-course. As it smote his ear, his frozen blood
leaped into life again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[118]</span></p>

<p>“Hush, woman!” and, catching her arm, he crushed
her to the floor. A hollow, ugly laugh greeted him,
as she twisted herself away, saying between her teeth:</p>

<p>“Did you enjoy the telegram?”</p>

<p>“Your cue on!” cried the call-boy, running up
behind. She rose to her feet, quickly tossed her
shaggy hair over her brow, and in a twinkling had
run upon the stage, while those two, staggering down
the stairs, heard a sound like silver bells and the
applause that greeted “Kitty who laughed.”</p>

<p>Gwendoline crouched like a frightened bird in the
dark corner of the hack, as it dashed along the streets;
and her companion&mdash;he, too, was as silent as the grave.</p>

<p>This then was the end! Worse for him than Gwendoline.
He had believed himself free; she had known
him but in his slavery and worshiped him so.</p>

<p>Bewildered, and blinded by his passion for her, that
night he had well nigh betrayed himself&mdash;and now
the end!</p>

<p>The carriage drew up at Mrs. Gwinn’s door, and,
dismissing it, he mounted the steps and silently pulled
the bell. Before it was answered, he took both her
hands in his,&mdash;those dear hands, hanging so white and
bare beside her&mdash;took them in his own, and held them<span class="pagenum">[119]</span>
for a moment to his bosom; then, turning up the
palms, he kissed first one and then the other passionately,
saying:</p>

<p>“God bless them! those brave little hands&mdash;God
bless them, forever!” and he was gone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Mrs. Gwinn returned home from the theatre,
she found her daughter in tears and learned from her
something of what had occurred behind the scenes.</p>

<p>“How strange we never knew her, mamma, often
as we have seen her act.”</p>

<p>“Not at all strange,” replied her mother, who was
moving about the room, arranging things for the night.
“What with her short dress, paint and powder, dyed
hair and artificial laugh, one would hardly recognize
the quiet dark girl who spent only a few short months
with us, then married Mr. Emory. I really don’t
think it necessary for you to worry about her. She
has passed completely out of our lives, and it makes
little or no difference what becomes of her.”</p>

<p>She did not wish to pursue the conversation further,
as her mind and inclinations were bent on the
completion of the match between her daughter and
the wealthy Southerner, Col. Coutell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[120]</span></p>

<p>But Gwendoline persisted in talking of her cousin,
as her mother moved restlessly about the room.</p>

<p>“You know they were not happy, mamma,” said the
girl, in a low tone, fraught with tears,&mdash;“and&mdash;and&mdash;I
am sorry for him, the&mdash;the husband she left.”</p>

<p>“Well!” said her mother, impatiently, “he might
get a divorce.”</p>

<p>“Get&mdash;a&mdash;divorce!”&mdash;and the figure lying half-dressed
before her sat up, drying her eyes, and, looking
in her face, with a startled expression, exclaimed:
“Am I dreaming? Did you say that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Mrs. Gwinn; “I said he might get
a divorce; but on what grounds I know not.”</p>

<p>She walked to the windows, shook out the curtains,
straightened a chair or two, in an aimless fashion,
thinking, for the first time, that she detected a chord
in her daughter’s voice and a look of the love she
had once half-suspected that she entertained for the
handsome blond who had married her niece.</p>

<p>“Might get I said, Gwendoline,” she repeated, “but
such things don’t grow on trees, as forbidden fruit
does. Ah! here is Alice to undress you. Take off
your clothes and go to bed; it is better to dream
than weep.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[121]</span></p>

<p>Closing her door, the mother went to her couch to
plan the campaign of the morn. Weary was the
woman of the struggle to keep up appearances. Surrounded
in her early youth by every luxury, she bore
but indifferently the adversities of poverty. Her daughter’s
beauty had won many admirers, but none so
worthy as Col. Morris Coutell, a man of ancient lineage,
possessing large estates and living alone on his
inheritance, a home of vast proportions, where the
mocking bird sang amid the countless trees, and flowers
waved their beauties in the ever blowing breezes
of the “Father of Waters.”</p>

<p>To dream like this sought she her pillow, picturing
Gwendoline the mistress of all, a fit queen to reign
over field and home, over master and slave. But to
that daughter came visions less charming. Into her
fitful slumber crept unwelcome images; men and women
in turmoil and the dust and glare of crowded grounds
seemed ever to make for themselves a picture on her
brain, and fill the night with horrors, till dawn came
and brought with its gray garments the coldness of
despair.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">“WITHIN A WEEK.”</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">A week went by. Clovis and her troupe were
gone, and the theatre closed for the summer.
She had not seen Neil before leaving, but no doubt
they would meet again in New York, as they had
often done before. It was not alone as the actress
who thrilled the hearts of the little city of N&mdash;&mdash;
that he knew her. They became acquainted elsewhere,
and their meetings were many and varied.
But it behooves us not to tarry to speak of them;&mdash;suffice
it to know that somewhere in the world, outside
of the hills of home, had he found her, and had
given, perhaps, a little more than passing homage to
this strange woman.</p>

<p>During that week he closed his apartments in town,
and sent his servant and his belongings to his country
place, fifteen miles away, and in a few days he himself
took the daily train which landed him but a mile
from his door. The winding drive and rich green<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>
lawn, studded here and there with shrubbery, formed
a refreshing sight to his city-weary eyes. The great
dog who bounded to meet him received the warmest
caresses; and the soft stillness of the evening air fell
like a veil of blessing upon him, as he sat alone on
his piazza.</p>

<p>“Here, at least, I am happy&mdash;here, at least, I may
rest.” And there came to him, this prayer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="indentquote0">“Calm me, my God, and keep me calm
</div><div class="indent1">While these hot breezes blow;
</div><div class="indent0">Be like the night dew’s healing balm
</div><div class="indent1">Upon my fevered brow.”
</div></div></div></div>

<p>And the picture of his mother rose before him, with
her hand on his shoulder, repeating those words, in
the twilight, long ago.</p>

<p>He was up in the early morning, and, mounting his
gray, rode forth amid the fields of grain. The mellow
air and leaping waters of the river beyond his door
were, indeed, like unto a “healing balm” to his torn
and wounded heart.</p>

<p>The sun was high in the heavens when he turned
his weary steed homeward. On his place all was in
order&mdash;for that, at least, he felt grateful. The bleating
of the sheep, mingling with the soft low of the cattle,<span class="pagenum">[124]</span>
told of prosperity. He returned by way of the
stable, and went in to look at his racer.</p>

<p>“You shall run no more, my boy,” he said, lightly
touching his glossy side. “Take off his halter, and
turn him loose upon the pasture, but look well to him,
lad, for I go away for months; and, as it fares with
him, so will it with you,” and, giving the reins of
his horse into the boy’s hands, he entered the house.
A day or two he lingered there, then was in the city
once more.</p>

<p>Peleg sang at his work, and swung his hammer
over his new anvil, as Emory greeted him one morn
with:</p>

<p>“Ah! I see you’ve kept the anvil, though you
refused the money.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the blacksmith, “this was a bargain,
sir; I stick to that, for I meant it when I told you
to book it;&mdash;and a pretty good thing it be! Thanks,
Mr. Emory!”</p>

<p>The gentleman sat himself down on a wooden
bench, just inside the door, watching the brawny, bare
arms of the worker of iron go up and down in their
physical beauty, while the red light from the sparkling
forge shone brightly on his honest, ruddy face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[125]</span></p>

<p>“So true to her!” he thought, “and must I be less
so?” Aloud, he said: “Peleg, I am going away, perhaps,
for years. Let me leave you a little income&mdash;something
to make your life a bit easier, your toil
lighter.”</p>

<p>“Bless you! Mr. Emory,” replied the man, “I’m as
happy as a king! There’s nothing I want&mdash;no worry
comes a-nigh us now. My good woman and me plod
on together as comfortable as can be. No! no! keep
your gold. I can always make a fair living, so long
as these don’t fail me,” and he held out his splendid
arms. “But I would ask a little favor of you&mdash;just
this&mdash;to let me shoe the racer, now and then, and to
ask Mr. Maury to send his bay boys here for me to
tap their hoofs. You see, I knows ’em all, and what
suits ’em.”</p>

<p>“That I will!” exclaimed Neil; “and, besides, I’ll
leave orders for you to do all my work, except Cliquot&mdash;you
cannot shoe him.”</p>

<p>“Why, sir? Him’s the one I thought on most.”</p>

<p>“Because,” smiled Emory, “he runs bare-hoofed
upon the paddock, old boy!”</p>

<p>And, crossing over to the blacksmith’s side, and laying
his hand on his shoulder, to keep him at his
work, he said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[126]</span></p>

<p>“Listen to me! I shall run him never again! That
race&mdash;be it the last! Tell her I said this&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;no
other shall ever mount him more!”</p>

<p>Then, with his hat over his face, he turned and
went away.</p>

<p>And ever, as the glowing iron took shape beneath
his blows, did the blacksmith think:</p>

<p>“I guess when a chain o’ gold has a broken link,
that’s hard to mend. I don’t know about such as
them, but it seems I welds my own tighter than
they.”</p>

<p>Then the sparks flew upward to the clear blue sky
and the unfinished song was taken up again.</p>

<p>Another week went by, and Neil had never seen
Gwendoline since that night; nor would he do so again
ere he left to wander for an indefinite space, to travel
in the old world, as he had done once before, there to
hide himself while his brain was filled with gloom
and the “tiger passions” were on him.</p>

<p>The ship, with its white sails and blue smoke, that
bore him away, was fading in the sunset of a summer’s
eve, when a missive from him was placed in
Gwendoline’s hand. It said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[127]</span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“I know now that I love you, and, lest I make of
that love a weapon that would destroy us both, I go
away. I leave you an inheritance of a deathless passion
that, in time of need, I bid you call upon. I
know, too, what you have done, and I will carry with
me, into those distant lands wherein I seek a little
solace, the image of that face, divested of its disguise,
as it lay white before me, upon the cushions of my
carriage, and those lips I dared not touch. Thank
God for this, and bid me keep this memory as one
of the jewels of your priceless heart&mdash;this one gem to
wear upon my own. Farewell, and, should we meet
no more, think as I do, oh! my darling, that, if separated
in this world of strife and though our paths of
brief existence lie apart, we may hope the immortal
life may seal our union in the sky.</p>

<p class="ir1 pminus1">“<span class="smcap">Neil Emory.</span>”</p>
</div>

<p>Lying upon the floor of her chamber, with the
letter crushed beneath her outstretched hands, Mrs.
Gwinn found Gwendoline; and as she raised her
stricken child she knew all hope had fled, and all her
dreams of that bright future, which she had planned
for her daughter, faded into nothing.</p>

<p>And so after awhile the courtly suitor, being convinced<span class="pagenum">[128]</span>
that his attentions were in vain, returned to
his home, that stately mansion where he dwelt
alone; henceforth, its spacious halls and frescoed
rooms were untenanted, save by his lonely presence
and the countless servants who did his bidding.</p>

<p>As he would listen in the mid-day to the sounds
from his sugar house and the whistling of his returning
laborers, he longed ever for one glimpse of a face
never to be his&mdash;for a voice to be heard by him no
more. Day by day he grew older and grayer, as he
sat at eve in the shadows of the fluted columns of
that broad piazza, looking towards those golden
waters, the sound of whose waves ever reached his
ears, in their ceaseless lap against the shore. But
the undying pain which he carried in his bosom
gave to his mien a gentler cast and to his voice a
softer tone, rendering him a kinder friend, a more
lenient master, a truer Southern gentleman!</p>

<p>Woe betide the day that deprived Gwendoline of the
privilege of joining hands with such as he, and thus
anchoring her storm-tossed bark in so secure a
haven!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="cheaderfont">IN THE CITY OF VIOLETS.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">To believe that the woman who could rear and
ride so spirited an animal as a thoroughbred
stallion would swoon away as Gwendoline had done
is a difficult matter. But such was the case, and
the mother, day by day, saw the color fade from the
cheek and the light go out from those glorious brown
eyes. Do what she would, the girl grew weaker
constantly, and when the heat of the long summer
came, Mrs. Gwinn felt her heart almost die within
her. There must be a change, or, the only thing on
earth for which she now cared to live, would pass
away forever. They were not rich enough to travel,
so she took her daughter to stay with some friends
in the mountains, where a little of the old energy
came back. But when the smoke from the fall fires
arose in the air above the city, Gwendoline returned
to her former listlessness. So, gathering together the
remnants of her fortune, Mrs. Gwinn took her child<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>
and maid and went to make a long sojourn in New
Orleans, that city of violets.</p>

<p>At first, she could not induce her daughter to re-enter
society; but fate assisted, for one day she
became acquainted with a sweet girl, who was gifted
with a wondrous voice. She could not play her own
accompaniments, however, and, as Gwendoline was a
fair performer, she often drew her into the hotel
parlors to play for her. The quiet rooms of the
“Veranda” were little frequented, and many hours
were spent there by those two; and, at times,
Gwendoline would be persuaded to go with her
friend elsewhere, so that she might sing her songs in
the homes of others. Little by little was she won
away from herself; and, at last, to please that
mother, now so devoted a parent, she again took her
place before the world, apparently fully restored to
health, beauty and good spirits. Beauty such as hers
can but attract admirers; and, in the handsome
saloons of private houses, as well as amid the public
places of amusement, did Gwendoline Gwinn again
reign supreme.</p>

<p>When the gayest month of the winter&mdash;February&mdash;came,
it brought with it Gray and Maury, who<span class="pagenum">[131]</span>
thought the smiles upon her lips were just as sweet,
though fraught with a sadness they had not known
before. Young Maury pressed his suit, but in vain;
and, at last, he, too, went home, a “sadder if not a
wiser man.” I do not think I have ever led you to
suppose that Reginald Gray had cared for her in a
lover-like way. His place in these pages has only
been that of Neil Emory’s friend&mdash;perhaps, one of
Gwendoline’s, too&mdash;and the would-be lover of that gloriously
seductive creature, Cassandra Clovis.</p>

<p>“Ah, me!” he thought, “I didn’t want the embers
of a heart, burned in the furnace of her love for my
friend,” and he heaved a sigh,&mdash;a rather uncommon
sound, as coming from so light a breast.</p>

<p>Let us trust that he will find on earth a fitting
mate, one who will give unto him the first sweet
love of her girlhood and lavish on those bright
features the purest and best of caresses. We bless
you, Reginald, and offer for you this prayer, knowing
as we do the purity of your heart, and so bid you
a last farewell.</p>

<p>One cold, raw evening, Gwendoline, returning from
a reception, entered her apartments through the sitting-room.
She found it dark, and, hearing Alice in<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>
the bed-chamber, passed on, and, giving her wraps
into her hands, returned to the sitting-room. She
was shivering from the cold, and, going to the fire,
stirred it to a blaze. The brightness illuminated floor
and ceiling, chairs and table, falling on the black
marble of the last-mentioned article of furniture, and
upon the whiteness of a visiting card that lay like a
snowflake before her, as she stood with her back to
the chimney. Leaning over, she took it up, and
turned it to the light behind her.</p>

<p>She was rolling it now softly, now fiercely, between
her fingers, when her maid spoke to her, asking some
questions about her wardrobe; then, finding herself unanswered,
she went again to her work of folding and
unfolding her mistress’ tumbled dresses. Presently,
Gwendoline moved and, darting into the other room,
said:</p>

<p>“When did this come?” and she held out the
card, adding: “And did you see him?”</p>

<p>“It came some hours ago,” replied the girl; “and,
yes, Miss, I did see him for a few moments.”</p>

<p>“And you never told me!”</p>

<p>“How could I? I have not seen you since,” and
Alice went on hanging and putting away the dresses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[133]</span></p>

<p>The mistress walked in a restless manner about the
room, then, stopping in front of the girl, asked:</p>

<p>“What did he say? Did he leave no message with
you? Speak! Why are you silent?” and she caught
her by the wrist.</p>

<p>“I am silent, Miss Gwendoline, because I do not
wish to tell you what he said, for&mdash;for&mdash;” and the
girl’s voice grew low, “I do not think you ought to
have his messages&mdash;and you ought not to see him
again.”</p>

<p>“Impossible! I must see him, if but for a moment!
I&mdash;I&mdash;have not seen him for over six months&mdash;think,
girl, of that&mdash;what a weary time!”</p>

<p>“Yes! it has been a weary time&mdash;and I know what
a weary time means!” sighed her maid.</p>

<p>“But the messages! Quick! Speak! Tell me what
they are! I must have them! Alice, you torture
me!” and Gwendoline stood before her, clasping and
unclasping her hands in restless impatience.</p>

<p>At that moment a knock sounded upon the door.
She flew to it herself, for some undefined instinct told
her that it concerned the dearest wish of her heart.
True, for a note was put into her hands&mdash;only a few
words, asking when he might come.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[134]</span></p>

<p>“I will send an answer,” she said, and the door
was shut.</p>

<p>She went to a desk, standing against the wall, and,
turning over its contents, dashed off a few hasty words,
folded and directed the note, looked up and met the
eyes of her maid, who stood before her.</p>

<p>“Do not send it, Miss Gwendoline, do not bid him
come, I implore you!”</p>

<p>“I shall not heed you, Alice. I must see him!”</p>

<p>“Oh!” cried the girl, approaching her, “listen to me&mdash;it
is wrong&mdash;wrong! I beg you to say him nay.
What will you gain by it? Say him nay, oh! say
him nay!”</p>

<p>“Again I tell you I must see him!” and she
started from her chair with an impatient gesture.</p>

<p>The girl threw herself upon her knees and caught
her dress.</p>

<p>“Oh! you do not know him!” she cried. “You
have not seen him as I have done to-day, when he
spoke of you. I&mdash;I&mdash;am afraid for you, my mistress!
I tremble for you! Here, at your feet, I implore you
to say him nay!”</p>

<p>Tears were in the upturned eyes and soon rolled
down the cheeks&mdash;tears were in the voice that besought
her to “say him nay.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[135]</span></p>

<p>But the now thoroughly aroused and passionate
heart heeded not the voice. The volcano, still so long,
had burst forth again.</p>

<p>She tore her dress from the figure crouching at her
feet, and, thrusting the note into Alice’s reluctant
hands, bade her rise and at once go forth upon her
errand, carrying those words that would bring him to
her in less than an hour. Turning at the door, the
girl lifted her hand and said:</p>

<p>“Oh! Gwendoline,&mdash;let me call you so this once&mdash;pause
before you act&mdash;remember my fate&mdash;think of
me!”</p>

<p>“Go! go!” she cried, wildly. “I can think of nothing
but him!” and, throwing her arms out across the
table before her, she buried her face in them as the
door closed.</p>

<p>When the maid returned, she found her mistress
tossing over the wardrobe, looking here and there for
some dress to suit her fancy.</p>

<p>“Make me beautiful, oh! make me beautiful!” she
ever murmured, as Alice stood, with trembling heart
and hands, to do her bidding. At last, she was ready.
She had selected a white directoire of soft material,
clinging to her form, falling from her shoulders in<span class="pagenum">[136]</span>
graceful folds and open at the throat to show the
whiteness of her skin. No jewelry of any kind adorned
her person, and she looked like a lovely statue as she
stood in the subdued light of her sitting-room, waiting
for the footsteps she had thought never to hear again.</p>

<p>Alice, lingering in the passage, opened the door to
him; then she slipped away to solitude and tears.</p>

<p>Gwendoline, with one hand resting upon the mantle,
turned her beautiful face, and, stretching out the other,
greeted him.</p>

<p>“I bid you welcome,” she said, softly, “back to
America.”</p>

<p>“And you,” he asked, “have you been well?”</p>

<p>“Not always,” she murmured.</p>

<p>The fire-light was the brightest in the room,&mdash;the
lamp behind them worried him with its dimness.
He arose and turned the wick higher.</p>

<p>“Now, I can see you better&mdash;do you pardon the
act? It is so long since I have looked upon your face,
Gwendoline,” and he reseated himself and drew his
chair close beside her.</p>

<p>She rested her head back against the cushions
behind her, and sighed a little.</p>

<p>“This is boy’s play,” thought Emory. “I must<span class="pagenum">[137]</span>
speak!” Then he said aloud: “Gwendoline, you
know what has brought me&mdash;I cannot live without
you! This I have come home to say. How fares it
with you?”</p>

<p>The lace on her bosom rose and fell, while the
white hands were clasping and unclasping, in a silent,
anguished way.</p>

<p>“Speak to me!” whispered her lover, bending over
her; “say that you feel as I do&mdash;let me have from
those lips the assurance that ’tis not mine alone, this
love that consumes.”</p>

<p>Rising slowly from her seat, Gwendoline stood for
a moment, swaying her tall form back and forth, with
outstretched hands, moaning aloud. He took those
hands between his own, and again besought her to
speak.</p>

<p>“What would you?” she cried, with flame-covered
cheeks. “Are you free?”</p>

<p>“Yes! but not as you think&mdash;not free as the world
would deem me&mdash;but free to love you and you alone!
Of every thought, where other women are concerned,
I am free! Gwendoline!” he cried, passionately, “give
yourself to me! Say, am I not everything to you?”
and he drew her towards him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[138]</span></p>

<p>She felt his arms about her, his hot and panting
breath upon her cheek, and her heart grew wild within
her.</p>

<p>“Not free! not free!” she moaned once more.
“Oh! Neil, I know not what to do!”</p>

<p>“Do as I bid you!” His gestures were almost
rough in their passion. “One word&mdash;will you be
mine, and mine alone?”</p>

<p>Still she shrank from him, trembling, afraid to
speak. He threw himself before her in a hurricane
of passion, and caught her to his breast.</p>

<p>“Tell me, shall I come again?&mdash;and when I do,
what shall it be?” His voice had grown hoarse and
low as he crushed her to his side. Her answer
reached him, and he knew then that for them both
Heaven would smile, though Hell be at their feet
when he came again.</p>

</div>


<p class="dropcap">And, even then, in the “City of Violets,” life went
on; even then the soft waters flowed against
the shore, or, going out to the ocean, carried upon
their bosom the stately ships, laden with spoils, and
hearts both sad and gay. The sun rose, to set again
in the west, just the same as ever; and music was on
the streets, while flowers and lights were everywhere.</p>

<p>If there were any other two, in all that seductive
place, who felt like these two of whom we write, it
mattered not to them. The days sped on alike, and
the nights, not a few, came and went, shaking their
starry banners over river and town; and yet, they had
not met; though she knew the day was not far distant
when he would “come again.”</p>

<p>Engagements of every kind filled her outward existence,
and her mother seemed ever ready to hurry
Gwendoline from theatre to ball-room, from dinner to
tea, and invent a thousand and one excuses to be with
her daughter, always keeping her on the go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[140]</span></p>

<p>Somehow she had learned of Emory’s return, and,
later on, of his arrival in the city; and, dreading a
meeting between Gwendoline and himself, she spared
no pains to avoid the chances of such an encounter.
She heard that he was stopping at the “St. Charles,”
and she rejoiced now that her daughter had from the
first sought a more quiet hotel. Mr. Emory went
little into society, and thus it was that at no time
had they met. As for that ever-to-be-remembered cold
evening, Mrs. Gwinn knew nothing of it. Alice had
kept her counsel, and Gwendoline nursed the secret
with the terrible words wrung from her in that hour.
One week, and then another went by&mdash;still no glimpse
upon the street, no looks from the opera stalls. Did
he go to one theatre, she was at another. Did he
walk upon Canal, she sped by in a carriage! Did he
call&mdash;she was gone!</p>

<p>At last, in despair, he moved his quarters, taking
up his abode but a few doors from her own, with his
windows looking out upon the same long, cool veranda.
But he would not show himself, would not startle her,
all too soon, either in the dining-hall or parlors. And
she,&mdash;how bore she the separation? More bravely
than you would think. Perhaps, she prayed that as
he came before he would not come again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[141]</span></p>

<p>“I am afraid, afraid!” she murmured.</p>

<p>One night, the wind blew soft as zephyr through
her curtains. She came home from the opera, and sat
in the dark to dream of him.</p>

<p>“Go away!” she said to Alice. “I will undress
myself!”</p>

<p>All was hushed and still on the street below, when
she pulled in her blinds and dropped her dress from
her shoulders. Piece by piece the garments fell from
around her, until but one remained, and her loosened
hair covered her bosom. She had lighted the gas and
saw herself reflected in the mirror beyond. She flushed
a sunset red.</p>

<p>“All this is for him!” she murmured.</p>

<p>In a moment the light was out and, with her night
dress wrapped close about her, she crept to her pillow,
shivering as with an ague.</p>

<br /><span class="cheaderfont">AT LAST.</span></h2>
</div>


<p class="dropcap">There came a bright and perfect day, followed by
a night quite its equal. Had a petition been
sent to the portals above, where the weather angel
sat, there could not have come from him more mellow,
golden hours than those that dawned for the
Cresent City that beautiful Wednesday of early March.
All along the flower-clad streets men and women
walked, sauntering, in their Southern fashion, stopping
now and then to greet each other, or to gaze in the
shop windows. The old peanut woman smiled upon
her stores as she kept the lazy flies away; and the
violet stands sold double their usual number of
bunches. Every one was out. Every one seemed
happy. Children, in white dresses and gay sashes,
wandered hand in hand along the street, their sweet
laughter mingling with the sounds around them.</p>

<p>In after years, how often came to those two the
memory of that brief morn. Alone, with folded arms,<span class="pagenum">[143]</span>
Neil stood and watched the setting sun, as it went down
across the waters at West End. The white sails of
countless pleasure boats were framed against the sky.
There came a strange, wild yearning in his heart to
be upon the deep once more&mdash;to go forever from all
this! And yet he could not leave her. He thought
of taking her with him to foreign lands and beginning
anew his life. But the end? What must it
be?</p>

<p>All day he had thought to seek her, and all day
he had not done so. He had walked the beautiful
streets in fierce restlessness, and there would come
again and again that feeling of solitude, impossible
to describe; and though the sound of her last hurried
whisper rang ever in his ear, still did he shrink away,
hugging to his breast the memory of a treasure he
longed yet dared not to look upon.</p>

<p>“Would that I might keep you pure, my love,
pure as the children I pass in the mid-day beams!”
and the man, stretching out his arms in the twilight
gloom, surrendered himself to his fate.</p>

<p>All through those golden hours, she, too, had
thought of him; she had spent the day across the
lake, wandering on the sea shore, pausing, now and<span class="pagenum">[144]</span>
then, in the shadow of some great tree to throw back
her light veil that she might watch the distant ships go
out into the ocean. She, too, had longed to be away
from “all this,” and still, ever with each fleeting
thought, came the heart cry, “I cannot leave thee,
for I know thou wilt come again!”</p>

<p>Back to the city, when the night dews fell, they
came; and, after she had rested a little, she went
with her mother to the theatre. They did not think
to look at the bills, before starting for the Grand,
nor ask the name of the troupe, so when the curtain
went up on the second act they were not a little surprised
to see an old friend step to the footlights.
Gwendoline whispered to her mother:</p>

<p>“Mamma, I am so glad we came. I have always
enjoyed her acting so.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Gwinn put up her glasses.</p>

<p>“Why, yes!&mdash;and it really is Clovis! I thought
she was in California!” said her mother.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, Madam,” remarked a stranger behind
them. “She is not going there until after her engagement
here; then, she leaves, never to return.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!” said Mrs. Gwinn. “I had not heard
that. Thanks for your kind information,” and she
turned her face to the stage, as the curtain rose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[145]</span></p>

<p>Like all Cassandra’s selections, the play was both
tasty and beautiful. Gwendoline thought her quite
as lovely as ever, only, perhaps, a little thinner, and
a “wee bit” worn in face and figure. The story of
the drama was one like unto her own life&mdash;the hopeless,
passionate love of a woman for a man, who had
given the best of his heart-treasures to another.
Emory, standing in the shade of a column, saw all and
felt her powerful language. Never had she acted as
now&mdash;never had her voice rung o’er pit and gallery
with such pathos. She never once saw him, or knew
that he was there. As if alone, and unto an unseen
world, did she pour forth the torrent of her affection,
and other hearts besides his were touched. The last
scene came. The dying footsteps of her departing
lover were heard no longer, and in solitude the lonely,
deserted woman stood, to speak in beauteous soliloquy
her parting words&mdash;to breathe her parting prayer.</p>

<p>With those glorious eyes upturned to a face she
seemed to see, while her white arms went out before
her and around her clung her flowing robes of snow,
stood the actress the people loved. Pale, and paler
still, she grew; and, back, within the shade, where
he sat, Emory saw the tears upon her cheeks and<span class="pagenum">[146]</span>
heard the sadness in the voice, as the soft roll of the
falling curtain shut that face from his gaze forevermore!</p>

<p>And that other&mdash;where was she? Her name was
not on the programme, but one woman behind the
scenes had he caught a glimpse of&mdash;a frail thing,
dressed in black lace, her head and shoulders enveloped
in a fabric of the same kind. Several times had
she passed in view, but his opera-glass told him
nothing.</p>

<p>It was long past midnight when he sought his
room. In spite of the lateness of the hour the lamps
burned in the long parlor. Throwing his window
open, he drew a chair to the railing of the veranda,
so that he might sit for awhile and enjoy the coolness
there. How clear seemed the skies above him,
studded with those myriad stars! How sweet the soft
winds of heaven!</p>

<p>The occasional roll of returning carriages was heard
in the street beneath, in whose cushioned depths sat
beautiful women, the glimpses of whose white hands
resting on the sills of the open windows, as they
caught the light from some street lamp, made his
pulses thrill when he thought of those other hands as
fair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[147]</span></p>

<p>Like threads of gold came the light from the parlor
windows into the gloom outside, and a little way
along another streamed, faintly dying against the railing
of the veranda. Turning his head, he saw it, and
wondered if she had come home.</p>

<p>“I must see her to-morrow,” he thought; “yes, let
the end be what it will! To-morrow, to-morrow,
Gwendoline! I will come again to-morrow!”</p>

<p>Rising, he walked slowly back and forth, in front
of his open window, with folded arms and stately
mien. Long he paced, till a little wearied; he paused
at last, and sank into a seat, with a sigh. Why, at
that moment, did he think of his wife Cecile, and
why did those thoughts assume a more kindly nature
than they had ever done before? Only the best of
her seemed to find an echo in the heart that loved
her not.</p>

<p>Would that he might see her once more, and,
having met, part from her in peace!</p>

<p>Where was that wandering one, who bound him
with so heavy a bond, to break which he strove in
vain? Why would she not, in mercy, stretch forth
her frail hands and unlink it, that his bark might go
where’er he guided it and not drift to unknown seas,<span class="pagenum">[148]</span>
where, at times, the softest winds foretell the coming
storm, the gentlest waves carry you on towards the
shore, where, finally, they become terrible breakers,
which wreck you among the reefs of despair! So he
must drift, drift ever on, “even unto death,” at whose
gloomy portals there was no respite.</p>

<p>Like a tired boy, he laid his head upon his arms,
thrown above the railing, against which he sat. At
that moment, he heard some one enter the parlor; and,
presently, a few chords on the piano reached him,
and then a voice arose in song&mdash;a sweet, low voice,
not strong, but clear and true. It stole out into the
midnight air and thrilled his throbbing breast. His
wife used to sing, but not like that. Her voice was
rich and full, soaring away, in high, passionate tones,
when such a mood was on her, or filled with witchery
at other times.</p>

<p>But this woman’s notes partook of neither of these
sentiments. Almost a wail in its witching music did
it sound; high and clear, soft and low&mdash;dying&mdash;dying&mdash;and
then it ceased, and she began to cough two or
three times, then convulsively. Emory stood up to
listen. Would this never end? Would she sing again?
No, for at that moment a man came out from the<span class="pagenum">[149]</span>
parlor, half supporting a woman, her head and shoulders
enveloped in black lace, with a handkerchief to
her face. There was no other chair, and Neil offered
his. As she sank into the seat, she took the cambric
from her mouth and looked at it&mdash;there were a
few dark spots on its folds.</p>

<p>“Ouch!” she said, “it looks like blood,”&mdash;and then
she began to cough again; a rattling sound smote the
listener’s ear, as a deep red stream issued from her
lips, finding its way to the floor. In a moment, she
fell back in her companion’s arms, quite insensible.
He supported her gently, and, turning to Neil, asked
where he could take her.</p>

<p>“In here,” and, drawing aside the curtains of his
own window, he motioned to the man to enter. He
did so at once, advancing to the bed, upon which he
placed the still insensible form of the woman, whose
dark dress streamed around her like a pall.</p>

<p>“Will you have a physician?” asked Emory.</p>

<p>“No,” replied the gentleman; “I do not think he
could do anything. Have you some ice water?”</p>

<p>Neil handed him a glassful from the table near by.</p>

<p>The man saturated his handkerchief and bathed the
blood-stained lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[150]</span></p>

<p>“She has been subject to hemorrhages lately,” he
said, addressing himself to Emory. “We were on our
way home from the theatre, and, seeing the hotel
lights up here, stopped for a moment for her to rest
a little, and then she tried to sing. Poor little woman&mdash;her
work is almost over now.” Then after a pause
he said: “I fear she is dying; have you no wife, no
sister to call?”</p>

<p>“I will call some friend;” but, before he could
leave the room, the form before them stirred, turning
the haggard, withered face to the light. Something
illumined the room&mdash;two glorious eyes, with the shadow
of death upon them. And then she spoke:</p>

<p>“Neil, it is I&mdash;it is Cecile!” and again she lay
quite motionless.</p>

<p>Through the door, which he had just opened, came
the sound of passing feet; he looked up, and, at that
moment, saw Gwendoline and her mother go by. He
ran into the passage, and overtook them as they were
about entering their apartments.</p>

<p>“Come with me!” he cried, excitedly.</p>

<p>Gwendoline gave a little cry at the suddenness of
his appearance, the oddity of his request, the strangeness
of his manner, and all at such an hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum">[151]</span></p>

<p>“Come with you? I do not understand! What
ails you?”</p>

<p>“Come, come!” he cried, excitedly. “Cecile is
here&mdash;Cecile is dying! Do come!”</p>

<p>“What mean you?” she gasped. “Cecile here&mdash;dying?
Oh, mother, let us go!”</p>

<p>He led the way, assuring them that no harm
awaited them, and that he did but wish them to
render service to a dying soul.</p>

<p>The man had lifted the fainting woman; her
emaciated form rested against his shoulder, as he supported
her on the side of the bed.</p>

<p>Emory moved in front of them, followed by his
trembling companions, who dared not speak. The
dying woman put out her hands, groping as if in
darkness, and as she felt Neil’s hands touch her own
a smile quivered over her lips, while, slowly and
with difficulty, she spoke:</p>

<p>“Neil, forgive!”</p>

<p>He bowed his head upon his breast, as the stranger
laid her down, and her eyes closed,&mdash;forever.</p>

<p>A cold hand touched his, and Gwendoline was
beside him. He drew her out upon the long piazza,
and they stood for a little while in silence beneath<span class="pagenum">[152]</span>
the stars. Then, opening his arms, he clasped her to
his heart, holding her there, as he had never held
her before.</p>

<p>Over the distant hills of Tennessee, a horse, feeding,
softly neighed, as he lifted his head to the night
breeze, and echo answered:</p>

<p class="stitle boldfont">“THREE GUARDSMEN SERIES.”</p>
</div>

<p class="center boldfont largefont pminus1"><em>Petersons’ Complete and Unabridged Editions.</em></p>

<p><em>Foremost among the greatest novels of any age stand the five absorbing romances
forming “The Three Guardsmen Series,” as published, by T. B. Peterson &amp; Brothers.
They are entitled respectively “The Three Guardsmen; or, The Three Mousquetaires,”
“Twenty Years After,” the Sequel to “The Three Guardsmen,” “Bragelonne, the Son
at Athos; or, Ten Years Later,” “The Iron Mask; or, The Feats and Adventures of
Raoul de Bragelonne,” and “Louise de la Valliere,” the Sequel to “The Iron Mask,”
and conclusion of the famous “Three Guardsmen Series” Written by the world-renowned
novelist, Alexander Dumas, the best and most powerful writer of fiction France
has ever produced, when first published they created an excitement unparalleled in
literary annals, and their vast popularity has been steadily maintained ever since.
This cannot be wondered at when the books are read, for their fascination, strength
and interest are unexampled. The original translations from the French of these
superb romances were made by that celebrated translator, Thomas Williams, Esq., for
T. B. Peterson &amp; Brothers, and are published only by them. They are altogether
complete and unabridged, faithfully reproducing every line that Dumas wrote just as
it came from his pen, without the slightest editing, adaptation or modification. They
are historical romances, filled to overflowing with love, stirring adventures, gallantry,
soldierly daring and manliness, plots and counterplots, dark deeds, political machinations,
virtue, vice, innocence and guilt. D’Artagnan, Athos, Aramis and Porthos
are the leading personages, and hosts of others fill their varied and important roles.
Much light is thrown upon the history of France and the French Court, and that mystery
which puzzled the world for nearly two centuries, the identify of the Prisoner in
the Iron Mask, is completely solved in a manner so powerful, interesting and ingenious
that this episode alone makes this series invaluable.</em></p>

<p><em>Mrs. Southworth’s works have become very popular, and they have great merits as fiction, for she
has written many good novels for the fireside, and furnished an amazing fund of pure and healthy
entertainment to thousands of readers that have been, and to many thousands more to come. The
great secret of her hold upon her readers is, after her inventive genius, in framing the plots of her
stories, and in the brisk and wide-awake manner in which all the details are executed. There is no
time for listlessness, every movement is animated; and she is not only a popular and entertaining
author, but a moral one, as she inculcates propriety, both by precept and by the example of her
characters, which are calculated to do good to all readers. Her works should be read by all, for
there is not a dull line in any of them, and they are full of thrilling and startling interest. Her
characters are drawn with a strong hand, and actually appear to live and move before us. Probably
no writer, man or woman, in America, is as popular, or has so wide a circle of readers as has
Mrs. Southworth. Her stories are always full of thrilling interest to lovers of the sensational,
and for literary merit they rank far above the works of any author or authoress of works of their
class. Mrs. Southworth’s stories have won their high place by her ability, and anything with which
her name is identified is certain to meet with hearty approval. The following are their names.</em></p>

<p class="stitle boldfont">CLIQUOT</p>
</div>

<p class="center sansseriffont boldfont largefont">A RACING STORY OF IDEAL BEAUTY.</p>

<p class="center xlargefont">BY KATE LEE FERGUSON.</p>

<p><em>“Cliquot,” by Kate Lee Ferguson, is a very clever and charming novel of the Amélie
Rives school, full of interest, beauty and piquancy. It enters into its subject without
the slightest delay, maintains continuous action and avoids digressions. Love, of course,
is its predominating theme, but much of its interest centres in the racing career of a
fleet thoroughbred stallion from which the romance takes its name and which by reason
of intractability and a habit of killing jockeys has failed in every race. Neil Emory,
the hero of the novel and his owner, however, finds a boy who manages to control and
bring him in a winner. The momentous race is described with such spirit and realism
that every patron of the turf will be fascinated, while even the general reader who has
no particular love for horse-flesh cannot fail to be thrilled, especially as there is a mystery
surrounding the youthful jockey which has a direct bearing upon the plot. Emory
is married and has not been released from the wife he has put aside, but this does not
prevent him from passionately loving Gwendoline Gwinn, the beautiful heroine and an
admirable character, by the way, strong in all those points which bring a man to a
woman’s feet and keep him there. Spicy incidents abound and are well worked up, particularly
those in which Cassandra Clovis and “Kitty Who Laughs,” a couple of actresses,
figure conspicuously. Cassandra is a handsome, passionate creature who loves
unbidden and suffers bitterly in consequence. “Kitty Who Laughs” is a mysterious
personage in whose history there is a decided pathetic element. The other personages
introduced are of minor importance, but well-drawn and representative types of Southern
character, for the scene of “Cliquot” is laid in the South, the most thrilling developments
taking place in New Orleans. The love passages, of which there are quite a number
in the delightful volume, are highly wrought and overflowing with ardent passion,
but altogether within the bounds of the natural. They will certainly stir a responsive
chord in the breast of every youthful reader and not a few of the older ones. “Cliquot”
is written in smoothly flowing style and is both breezy and touching. Its plot is very
creditable and the denouement is brought about with a fair degree of skill. The novel
will be sure to find many readers and of course will be widely talked about, as in parts
it ventures upon ground where delicate treatment is imperative. Amélie Rives has
published nothing more passionate and her best works have not caused the sensation
“Cliquot” is likely to create.</em></p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
